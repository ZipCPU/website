    <h2 id="welcome-to-formal-quizes">Welcome to Formal Quizes!</h2>

<p>Since I have enjoyed sharing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FVQuiz">formal verification quizzes on
twitter</a>, and since they’ve been such
a well received part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/ZipCPU">feed</a>,
I thought I’d add these same quizzes to the blog.</p>

<p>The spirit of these quizes is intended to be fun.  They are drawn from the
slides for my <a href="/tutorial/formal.html">formal verification
course</a>.  The format limits the quiz
questions to a single slide.  The up side is that the quizzes tend to be
simpler.  The downside is that there’s a challenge required on my side to
make them understandable and complete as well.  (I don’t always succeed at
this.)</p>

<p>Take as much time on each quiz as you would like.  I encourage you to
create small designs to try each concept using
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a> and to see what
happens when possible.  I also anticipate posting the answer to the quizzes
within days of the quiz itself.  Once posted, the image containing the quiz
will become a web link, and there will also be a link underneath pointing to
the answer page.  By the time most people come across any particular quiz,
the chances will be that the answer is already posted.</p>

<p>Be aware, I enjoy posting trick questions!</p>

<p>You may also notice that I’ve added two new links to the navigation bar.
The first link will be to an <a href="/quiz/quizzes.html">index page</a>,
linking to all the various quiz posts.  The other is to a
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZipCPU">Reddit feed</a> I’ve created to go with the
blog itself.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
