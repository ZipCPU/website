<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/3211-back-the-fft-again">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>My advice to anyone working on such a problem like this is that you need to
build the debug infrastructure first, before you try to implement an FFT.
Here on this blog, we’ve already discussed most of the pieces describing how
to do just that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You start by getting a simple means of communicating with the device working</p>

    <p>We discussed an example of getting a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">basic serial port</a> up and running <a href="/blog/2017/05/24/serial-port.html">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You use that communications channel to get some kind of bus up and running
on your FPGA.  (I prefer <a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">wishbone</a>.)
You then use this bus to read from
the internal variables of your FPGA, or set variables within it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once built, you can then use one of your peripheral registers to control a
stepping signal, so as to step all of your logic under test by one clock.</p>

    <p>We discussed how to turn a serial port into such a debug peripheral
<a href="/blog/2017/05/26/simpledbg.html">here</a>.  We’ll discuss
it more in the context of an FFT below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This works when debugging the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/xfft/v9_0/pg109-xfft.pdf">Xilinx FFT</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">my own FFT</a>.  Indeed, debugging
any FFT is no more difficult than debugging any other component, as we’ll
discuss in this post.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-you-need-to-break-up-the-problem">Why you need to break up the problem</h2>

<p>The first step, though, is to break the problem into pieces, and to debug
each piece individually.</p>

<p>FFT’s are rarely found all alone.  Usually, they are found within a larger
context.  They are often connected to 
a sampling device, there may be other processing in front of them, and the
whole often runs faster than your debug interface.  Put together, a simple
FFT architecture might look like:</p>

<p><img src="/img/multi-block-fft.svg" /></p>

<p>The problem with this simple architecture is that, unless you can isolate the
FFT component by itself, you will never know which of the components in this
processing chain is failing.  This was the problem the
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/3101-problems-fft-ip-core-v90">Digilent poster</a>
had when trying to get his FFT working.</p>

<p>This post will discuss how to isolate just the FFT.</p>

<p>Ideally, you could build a simulation which would allow you to simulate how
this FFT works.  However, if you are like me and enjoy building simulations
from open source tools only,
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> for example,
then you’ll be stuck and unable to simulate a proprietary IP core anywhere other
than on the FPGA itself.  Hence, we’re going to run our test benches on the
FPGA hardware itself.</p>

<p>To do that, we’re going to add a <a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">wishbone</a> slave interface to our FFT, so that
you can debug the FFT, and only the FFT, just like you would read and write
from any <a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/29/simple-wishbone.html">wishbone slave peripheral</a>.</p>

<h2 id="my-example">My example</h2>

<p>The following is an example piece of code, cut from a time when I needed to
debug
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/xfft/v9_0/pg109-xfft.pdf">Xilinx’s FFT</a> within one of my designs (I was comparing their
implementation to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">my own</a> at the time).
Minimal edits have been made to simplify the presentation.</p>

<p>As with any test, you want to start from known conditions.  This test is no
difference.  Hence, our first step will be to reset the FFT.  We’ll do that by
setting the reset line any time the user writes to the zero address associated
witht he FFT.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="c1">// Writes to the control register reset the FFT.  Note that the reset lasts</span>
<span class="c1">// only one clock</span>

<p>The register names should
be familiar from either the <a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">wishbone spec</a>, or <a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/29/simple-wishbone.html">our discussion</a> on how to build a simple wishbone slave.</p>

<p>The next step is to set up the input value for the each FFT clock.  In our
case, we’ll set one input value any time someone writes to the bus.   Well,
almost.  In my example, I have two input samples because I was testing a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">two-sample input FFT</a>.</p>

<p>Since I was setting the values two at a time, you’ll notice the FFT input values
are name <strong>fft_in_left</strong> and
<strong>fft_in_right</strong>—the even and odd inputs to the FFT respectively.
Likewise, you may also notice that I accepted FFTBITS per input.  This allowed
me to experiment with input samples having less than 16-bits each, even though
I was passing two values at a time (real and imaginary) packed into the upper
bits of each half-word.</p>

<p>Now that the FFT has its inputs given and assigned to it, we then need to
step the clock by one tick, and one tick only.  To do this, we’ll use the
clock enable (ce) line found within each FFT.  We connect this clock enable
line to the bus via a bus write: any time the user writes to address 3 of our
bus, the clock enable line will get set for one clock tick.</p>

<p>You may notice that this is also the register for one of our inputs
(<strong>fft_in_right</strong> above).  In this fashion, we only need to set the inputs in
order to have the FFT step forward by one clock tick.</p>

<p>The last step is to read the results from the FFT.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="c1">// Reads from the FFT control logic</span>

<p>The first register allowed me to read back the status from the FFT itself.
In particular, the FFT sets a synchronization flag on the first valid
output from the FFT.  In order to align our results with the FFT, we need
to read that flag.</p>

<p>Reads from addresses two and three allowed us to verify that the bus was
working, by simply reading back the values we’d written to the input channel.</p>

<p>Reads from addresses four and five allowed us to read the result from the FFT.</p>

<p>The <strong>o_wb_ack</strong> and <strong>o_wb_stall</strong> lines can use the same logic as we
used for our <a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/29/simple-wishbone.html">simple wishbone slave implementation</a>.</p>

<p>That’s it!  You can now debug an FFT as a wishbone slave component, feed it
with your test data, and single step it to see what it does and how it works!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, we’ve now discussed how to debug an FFT isolated from everything else.
With a little ingenuity, you should be able to figure out how to debug any
other DSP logic on your FPGA in a similar fashion.  This approach should get
you to the point of being able to debug your processing flow all the way from
the Pre-DSP component through to your reported results.</p>

<p><img src="/img/fft-almost-there.svg" /></p>

<p>Where this approach fails is when you have real–time inputs to your FFT that
you cannot slow down–such as the results from any analog to digital
converter.  There are two approaches to that problem:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can copy the outputs of your sampler directly into a buffer, record that
  buffer, and then use the data from that buffer as inputs to your FFT.  That
  will allow you to continue using this debugging approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can also use some form of a scope to capture a snapshot of the
  real–time data as it runs through the FFT.   This is the approach used by
  the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a>, and an approach
  we’ll slowly work up to within this blog.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Which solution should you use?  Both!  But … we’ll get back to that in a
later post.</p>
