    <p>One common request on Digilent is the, “Can I do XYZ on board ABC”?</p>

<p>I really dislike answering questions of this type.  I’ve been surprised too many
times by someone doing what I thought was impossible.  Indeed, I’ve also had my
own opportunities to surprise others by doing things they thought were
impossible.</p>

<p>A couple examples should illustrate this point:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I gave up early on the idea of building a Video game on a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">Basys-3
 board</a>.
 I figured the task was just plain impossible: although you can make
 a 128kB of block RAM on the board, there wasn’t enough memory on
 the board for a 640x480 piece of video memory, with a bare minimum of four
 bits per pixel (256kB required) and the Basys-3 <em>only</em> has the
 block RAM on board.</p>

    <p>Since giving up, I discovered some individuals had done it.  Digging
 into those who were willing to share, I learned how they had done it. 
 They took the video stream, and wrote characters directly on the stream
 using FPGA hardware.  That way, there was no storage requirement.  I
 had already done something similar to place a mouse on the screen, so
 I shouldn’t have been as surprised as I was.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When presenting at <a href="https://orconf.org/2016/">ORCONF</a> some time ago, I had
 the opportunity to meet my first Digilent employee.  When I shared with him
 what <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">I had done</a> with their
 <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod S6</a>, and specifically how I had managed
 to place a multi-tasking O/S (as I called it) on the board, he was
 exceptionally impressed.  Particularly since he had written off the board as
 being unfit for this type of task.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The only question left, therefore, is where the next surprise is coming from.</p>
