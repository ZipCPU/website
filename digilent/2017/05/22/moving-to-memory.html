    <p>There seems to be a difficult transition between the beginning FPGA
designer, and the more experienced designer.  From the posts I’ve watched
and replied to, this transition appears to be centered around accessing
memory.</p>

<h2 id="before-memory">Before Memory</h2>

<p>Usually, a beginner’s FPGA work consists of very simple tasks: building a serial
port, controlling LED’s, <a href="/blog/2017/05/19/blinky.html">making things blink</a>,
and so on.  These tasks can seem fairly simple, and they can usually be solved
with only some simple Verilog.</p>

<p>Once the beginner has successfully completed these tasks, they then try to 
move on to something real.  For example, maybe they want to record some video,
capture images from a camera, or even to transmit a song over a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbfmtx">FM radio peripheral</a>.
Every one of these tasks, though, requires memory.  These beginners quickly
discover that … there’s just not that much block RAM within an FPGA.</p>

<p>What these beginners want is to continue their learning process just like
they’ve done it up to that time.</p>

<p>This is where they get stuck.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-memory-different">Why is memory different</h2>

<p>Up until this point, when building for an FPGA, they can access as many memories
as they want within their FPGA.  When they need a memory, the just connect it
to their circuit.</p>

<p>Now, when they need a big memory from an external circuit, … there’s only
one memory pipe.  Anything that needs to access that memory, needs access to
the one and only memory pipe’s controls.   The controls look much like any
bus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Given an address and a read strobe, return the value at that address.</li>
  <li>Given an address, a data value, and a write strobe, replace the contents at
that address with the new data value.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this, you need a bus.</p>

<p>Many different bus standards exist.  There’s the
<a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>, the
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">B4 version of the Wishbone</a>
that I like and use, there’s the
<a href="http://opencores.org/cdn/downloads/wbspec_b3.pdf">B3 version</a>
used by the <a href="https://openrisc.io">OpenRISC</a> team,
there’s the <a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI bus</a>
used by <a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> and ARM, etc.</p>

<p>By itself, using the <a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">wishbone bus</a>
is pretty easy.
<a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI</a>
is harder, but once you understand how a bus works its not that much harder.
We’ll come back to that later with some easy examples of how to use one.</p>

<h2 id="beginners-should-get-used-to-busses">Beginners should get used to busses</h2>

<p>Before trying to read from memory or building a memory controller, a beginner
should learn how to read and write from a bus.  Lots of simple things with
busses are really appropriate beginner tasks.</p>

<p>For example, a very simple piece of bus logic is a bus arbiter. 
Since only
one piece of logic can access the memory at any given time, if you want
two pieces of logic to be able to access memory, you need a bus arbiter.
(See <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/ex/wbarbiter.v">here</a>
for a wishbone example.)</p>

<p>A classic example of this would be a project that reads from a camera port and
writes the result to memory.  If you ever want to get that image out of memory,
you will need an arbiter controlling which logic has access to the bus.</p>

<p>As another example, if you are going to build a bus, why not put some <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">
debug logic</a> on that bus?  It’ll make
getting your memory interface up and running later a whole lot easier.</p>

<p>The simplest bus to get used to is one where every item on the bus has exactly
the same timing.  A simple debug port might be like this.</p>

<p>A harder bus is one where requests must be held on the bus until the respective
peripheral is ready to read them.
(<a href="http://opencores.org/cdn/downloads/wbspec_b3.pdf">WB B3/Classic</a>)</p>

<p>Harder still, one where many requests may be made before the first result comes
back, some variable number of clocks later.
(<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">WB B4/Pipeline</a>)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI</a>
bus, though, usually takes the cake for complexity.  This bus has separate
channels for read requests, write requests, write data, read data, and the write
request acknowledgement.  Each of these channels has bi-directional flow control
so that requests may have to wait for the peripheral to be ready.  Worse,
this bus may respond out of order to various requests.  Ouch!</p>

<h2 id="actual-memory-controllers-are-complicated">Actual memory controllers are complicated</h2>

<p>Finally, once you are comfortable using a bus, only then is it time to connect
it to a memory controller.</p>

<p>This is also where the beginner punts and looks for a prewritten memory
controller—usually because he has never learned how to deal with a bus,
or he’s read the memory controller spec sheet and … decided it wasn’t worth
his while.</p>

<p>These beginners will also tend to switch to the
<a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI</a>
bus, not because they know
how to use it, neither because it’s the best bus out there, but because
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> has provided them with a memory controller
for their memory chip that uses the
<a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI</a>
bus.</p>

<p>This is usually also the time in their development where they abandon the
Verilog or VHDL code they’ve been working with in favor of one of the visual
and graphical tool flows.</p>

<p>This leads to a bigger problem down the road: they’re stuck using the Xilinx
IP because 1) building
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/axilscope.v">something</a> that
interacts on an
<a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI</a>
bus isn’t simple, and
2) because it’s difficult to integrate their special sauce into the official
IP integrator.  Indeed, the problem is so complicated that 
<a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI</a>
has to offer a special subset of the AXI bus specification, AXI-lite, just to
try to make this easier.</p>

<h2 id="stick-around-and-ill-show-another-way">Stick around, and I’ll show another way</h2>

<p>Having now written several memory controllers, I understand they can be
difficult.  They are also, however, quite possible to build.  The beginner
who abandons their learning process for a set of ready-set of tools, however,
will quickly loose the fortitude they need to get there.</p>

<p>If you stick around on this blog, I intend to show you another way.</p>
