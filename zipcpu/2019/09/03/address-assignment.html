  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Some time ago, I figured out a basic address assignment algorithm for use in
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>.
At the encouragement of <a href="https://twitter.com/ZipCPU">my twitter</a> followers, I
thought it might be valuable to share this algorithm here.</p>

<p><a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>,
as you may recall, connects peripherals (<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/tree/dev">and now multiple masters
in the dev branch</a>) to any
respective buses you might wish to assign them to.  While
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
is primarily a copy-paste design facility with some calculation mixed in,
address assignment is one of several exceptions to this rule.</p>

<p>Consider as an example the bus structure shown in Fig. 1.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1. Example multi-level bus structure</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/address-assignment/generic-bus-diagram.svg" alt="" width="720" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In this structure, you can see three bus masters, together with four basic
slaves, four <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DOUBLE</code>-type slaves, and four <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SINGLE</code>-type slaves.  Slave one
in particular provides access to a second bus having two slaves on it.</p>

<p>To assign addresses to all of these peripherals,
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
generates and maintains a list of buses found within the design.  Each bus
is composed of a number of peripherals (the PLIST), and one or more masters
(the MLIST).  Certain special “subbus” or “arbiter” masters are able to cross
from one bus to another, making it possible to have hierarchical bus structures,
such as Fig. 1 shows above.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 2. Example multi-level bus structure</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/address-assignment/bus-lists.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p><a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>s
first task is to <a href="/zipcpu/2019/08/30/subbus.html">split each bus into three
parts</a>: The first is for
peripherals of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SINGLE</code>.  These are single register peripherals whose
register is immediately available for reading or writing, and who don’t stall
the bus.  The second set of peripherals, those of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DOUBLE</code>, can have
more registers internal to them.  This set requires a single clock period to
return a value from a bus request.  As with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SINGLE</code> list, this set is
not allowed to stall the bus either.  The last set of peripherals contains all
other types of peripherals.</p>

<p>For <a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/29/simple-wishbone.html">WB peripherals</a>,
the entire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SINGLE</code> peripheral set is turned into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DOUBLE</code> peripheral, and
then that peripheral is turned into a regular peripheral of the normal variety.
While this is captured in Figs. 1 and 2 above, I haven’t yet decided if I will
do the same thing for the
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a> interface or not.</p>

<p>Address assignment then starts at the lowest level of the bus structure, and
then works its way up to the top.  Within any given level, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SINGLE</code> set is
assigned first and formed into its own peripheral, then the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DOUBLE</code> set,
and then peripheral assignment is done on the rest of the bus.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an example from one of my more recent projects.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3. Abbreviated bus design from a recent project</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/address-assignment/sonar-design.svg" alt="" width="720" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In this project there’s your basic
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>, and then
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash</a>,
SDRAM, network, and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SD-Card</a>
peripherals.  Indeed, this much of the design is based upon my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip">VideoZip design</a>.  Now, using
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>,
I can add a basic SONAR transmit controller and a boot ROM section so my
customer doesn’t need to load code into the design himself.  (The boot ROM
slave isn’t shown in Fig. 3 above.)  Finally, there’s a data recorder shown
above as the “DMA” in the picture.  If you look carefully, you’ll notice this
same slave exists on the bus in two places: once where for the control port
where it receives its commands, and again for the memory access portion
where it masters the bus.  Xilinx users might be familiar with the similar
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/axi_datamover/v5_1/pg022_axi_datamover.pdf">AXIS2MM data mover
peripheral</a>,
but this particular one is my own WB creation and no real relation to theirs.</p>

<p>Let’s spend a moment to see how
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
handles this address assignment problem.</p>

<h2 id="address-decoding">Address Decoding</h2>

<p>The first step to understanding how address assignment works is to understand
how addresses are decoded.  <a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">As we’ve discussed
before</a>, address decoding is
done with two values: an address and a mask assigned on a per-slave basis.  A
particular peripheral is selected if the requested address matches the slave’s
address everywhere a mask bit is set.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">peripheral</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">valid_request</span>
		<span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">requested_address</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">SLAVE_MASK</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">SLAVE_ADDR</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You might also equivalently write,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">peripheral</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">valid_request</span>
		<span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="p">(((</span><span class="n">requested_address</span> <span class="o">^</span> <span class="n">SLAVE_ADDR</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">SLAVE_MASK</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Both should generate the same logic.</p>

<p>In general, the goal of address assignment is to both minimize the number of
mask bits and the number of address bits at the same time.</p>

<p>Sound simple?  Let’s find out how this works.</p>

<h2 id="easy-address-assignment">Easy Address Assignment</h2>

<p>Just to illustrate the issue of address assignment, let’s start out with a
basic set of peripherals and assign an address to each of them.  I’ve chosen
a set of 12-peripherals for this purpose, shown in Fig. 4 on the right.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 4. Example slave peripherals</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/address-assignment/sample-plist.png" alt="" width="296" /></td></tr></table>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first “peripheral” is the null space.</p>

    <p>My initial designs didn’t include this null space.  Shall we say I got
burned and then painfully learned the wisdom of my ways?</p>

    <p>The story dates back to before I implemented illegal instruction detection
in the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>,
feeling at the time that it was “optional”.  (I don’t feel this way any
more.)  Then one day something went wrong.  Somewhere, a pointer got set
to address zero.  Worse, all of my peripheral addresses were packed near
zero at the time.  The result was that the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> started
wildly writing errant data to the peripheral address space.</p>

    <p>By the time I had realized what was happening, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>
had written to the flash configuration control register and switched
some of the one-time programmable configuration bits.  My
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/arty-a7-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists">Arty</a>,
while usable, has never been the same since.</p>

    <p>I’ve also learned to add illegal instruction detection and bus error
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a> detection to the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>,
and similarly a null space to my address assignments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next couple of peripherals in this example set are <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">Wishbone
Scopes</a>.
These require only two addresses, 4-bytes each, one for control and one
for data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also have a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpmic">microphone peripheral</a>
with a similar addressing scheme–one address for control and one for data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next peripheral is my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">WBUART
peripheral</a>.  This has transmit and
receive registers, as well as protocol control and FIFO status registers.
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/wbuart.v">This
peripheral</a>
therefore requires address space for four 32-bit registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/tree/enet/rtl/ethernet">RGMII</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/tree/master/rtl/enetpackets.v">RMII</a>
controllers need two address regions–one for packet
memory and another for the controller.  The
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/tree/enet/rtl/ethernet/enetpackets.v">controller</a>
itself requires eight 32-bit registers to control the transmitter, the
receiver, the MAC address,
and to some feedback counters to capture the number of aborted packets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are followed by the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/blob/master/rtl/enetctrl.v">network management data port</a>.  My network
management controller provides a separate address for everything in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_Data_Input/Output">MDIO</a>
address space, so it requires 128 bytes of address space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The network packet memory needs to be sufficiently large to hold both a
received packet as well as the packet to be transmitted next.  Let’s pick
a memory area 32,768 bytes wide (two 16kB packets) knowing that we can
adjust this for other architectures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I don’t typically use a first-stage boot-loader, one of the projects
I’m working on requires it.  That project requires a boot-ROM so we’ll throw
it in here.  A block-ROM of 256kB is more than sufficient to read a
program from an SD-card and copy it to RAM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ll then scrap together whatever’s left of our FPGA block RAM components
in order to create a <a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">1MB block RAM
peripheral</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also have a <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash
   peripheral</a> in this
   sample list.  It seems there’s a large set of
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">flash</a>
   peripherals stuck at 24-bit addressing, so this will give us a
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">flash</a>
   size of 16MB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our final peripheral is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">DDR3
   SDRAM</a> having 512MB of memory.
   My current approach to this is to use the basic MIG controller, coupled
   with a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axisp/blob/master/rtl/wbm2axisp.v">Wishbone to AXI
   bridge</a>.
   As you’ll see in a moment, the sheer size of this particular peripheral will
   dominate much of how our address assignment algorithm will work.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, let me ask, how would you assign addresses to these peripherals?</p>

<p>Ideally, what we might want would be a one-hot addressing scheme where
you could tell which peripheral was addressed by a single bit in the
address space.  While this sounds like an awesome idea, it fails in
practice any time an errant program accesses an address with more than one
of these otherwise one-hot bits set.  If both peripherals respond,
… “bad” things will happen.  The bus, for example, might lock up until
the next power cycle.  This is usually quite “bad”.</p>

<p>This would also break the <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">fundamental rule of all bus
work</a>: for every request,
there is one and only one response.</p>

<p>No, we want to make certain instead that our address assignment method works
in such a way that only one slave will ever be addressed at a time.  It doesn’t
matter if “non-allocated” addresses select that slave, but it does matter if any
addresses select more than one slave at a time.</p>

<p>Perhaps the easiest way to do address assignment might be to first find
the slave with the biggest address width, and then assign an address space
that big to every slave.  Since the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">SDRAM</a>
requires an address space of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x2000_0000</code> bytes, we’ll assign every peripheral that many bytes and just
count up.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 5. Example slave peripherals</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/address-assignment/simple-assignment.png" alt="" width="643" /></td></tr></table>

<p>As you can see from Fig. 5 on the left, we overran our 32-bit address
space and now need a 33-bit address space.
You can also see that our 8-byte peripherals were assigned 512 MBs of
address space each.  This would sort of be like running a parcel shipping
business and only supporting one size container–train box cars.</p>

<p>Practically, this will never work.</p>

<p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
only supports a 32-bit address space (i.e. 30-bit word address space), and
of that address space there’s a reserved portion at the end from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff00_0000</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xffff_ffff</code>.</p>

<p>Before we abandon this approach though, let’s see what else we might learn
from it.  For example, the address decoder could decode all of these separate
peripheral address ranges with a simple 4-bit lookup table, checking only
address bits 33-29 as indicated by the mask, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x1_e000_0000</code>.</p>

<p>While this is a low-logic decoder, it does have a consequence.  Low-logic
means that peripherals with a small address range may exist at multiple
locations in the address map.  To continue our parcel shipping analogy, many
loaves of bread might find in a package big enough to hold a sofa–why
only pack one peripheral in such a large address space?</p>

<p>Further, consider how the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART
peripheral</a> exists from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x8000_000f</code> to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x9fff_ffff</code> even though it only uses four registers within that range.
What happens, then, is that all of the addresses within this range will
alias into the same four peripheral registers, allowing the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART</a>
to be addressed anywhere in that address region.  We’ll touch more on this
in the next section.</p>

<p>For now, we can summarize our success, or lack thereof, by two metrics–the
address width required to access all of these peripherals (33 bits–too many),
and the number of mask bits necessary to select between them, 4-bits.</p>

<p>Can we do better?</p>

<h2 id="tightly-packing-addresses">Tightly packing addresses</h2>

<p>When I first started trying to handle address assignment, I would pack as many
peripherals as I could into a given address area.  Here’s how that algorithm
worked:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’d first sort all the peripherals, leaving the null space at zero of course.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you’ve noticed that I’ve already sorted the peripherals listed
in Fig. 4 above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’d initialize my work by setting a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start_address</code> either to 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each peripheral, starting with the “empty” null-space and working down
the list, I’d add to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start_address</code> the size of the peripheral, minus
one byte.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">	<span class="n">pa</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">peripheral</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">address_width</span><span class="p">();</span>
	<span class="n">periphera</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">base_address</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">start_address</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="n">pa</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <p>This would be guaranteed to overflow if there weren’t enough bits to
support my requested address range.  For example, suppose the start address
was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x40</code> and I wanted to allocate space for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/blob/master/rtl/enetctrl.v">MDIO 
peripheral</a>–requiring
a register space of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x80</code> octets.  If you add these two together, you’d
get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x40 + 0x80 = 0xc0</code>.  Subtracting one brings you to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xbf</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now I can trim off the bottom bits, to guarantee the peripheral can use
an address mask.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">	<span class="n">pa</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">peripheral</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">address_width</span><span class="p">();</span>
	<span class="n">periphera</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">base_address</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1l</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">pa</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<ol start="6">
  <li>
    <p>To follow our example from above, this would force the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/blob/master/rtl/enetctrl.v">MDIO
peripheral</a>
needing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x80</code> bytes of address space to have a start address equal to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x80</code>–plenty of room, and with a guaranteed 7-bits to reference values
within the peripheral.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can then increment our start address to be ready for the next peripheral.
The new start address must be just following our assigned address space.
So, for our</p>

<ol start="8">
  <li>Then, as a first pass to knowing what mask bits we require, we set our

<p>The two <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">scopes</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpmic">microphone</a> all use two words of
address space.  We can therefore pack them tightly together.  However, when
we get to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART</a>,
we need an address that’s aligned with four bus words.  Rounding up to the
nearest address that’s aligned with four bus words is going to require
stuffing two words of unused space into our address space as shown in Fig.
6 on the right.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 7. Adding the network control port</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/address-assignment/network-plus-uart.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Once we’ve assigned the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">scopes</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART</a>, it’s now time to assign an
address to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/tree/master/rtl/enetpackets.v">network control
port</a>.
This peripheral needs an address aligned to eight 32-bit words.  However,
if you shuffle everything to an eight word width, you’ll find that the network
control addresses don’t fit unless you skip some more space.</p>

<p>As you can see, we’re working from the smaller peripheral to the larger
ones.  At each level, the peripheral needs to be assigned to an address
aligned to the size of the peripheral.</p>

<p>That’s what the algorithm above does.</p>

<p>As a last step, we’ll measure the total number of bits required to do this
address decoding (30 bits), and then trim any mask bits to just that many bits.
The result would be a set of base addresses and masks describing a “full
address decoder”.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 8. Full address decoding</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/address-assignment/full-address-decoding.png" alt="" width="589" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This time, you’ll notice from Fig. 8 above that we’ve done much better at
minimizing the number of address bits than we did in our first attempt shown
in Fig. 5 above.  But 27 mask bits?  Not so much.</p>

<p>If low logic were important to us, and it has always been to me since more
logic costs more money, we might choose to just check the minimum mask bits
necessary to separate peripherals.  This would be a “partial address decoding”,
since it would leave holes in the address space.  You can see how this might
work in Fig. 9 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 9. First cut at partial address decoding</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/address-assignment/first-pass-partial.png" alt="" width="589" /></td></tr></table>

<p>If you count number of bits used in the masks of Fig. 9, you’ll get eleven
non-zero bits.  Eleven mask bits would mean that decoding a peripheral’s
address would require a comparator with a length somewhere between one
bit (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">SDRAM</a>)
and 11-bits (the <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">WB
Scopes</a>).
Decoding addresses using an 11-bit mask would <a href="/blog/2017/06/12/minimizing-luts.html">require between two and three
LUTs per slave</a>
depending on your architecture.</p>

<p>While this kind of “partial address decoding” is both common and cost
effective, it’s been known to surprise those who aren’t familiar with it.
Consider as an example address <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x210_0000</code>.  Since the
block RAM’s mask only checks bits <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x2110_0000</code>, our address decoding
algorithm above will map this address to the block RAM–even though the
block RAM’s official address space only exists between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x10_0000</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x1f_ffff</code>.  On the other hand, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x20c_0000</code> would map to our block <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ROM</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x30c_0000</code> would map to our <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">Flash
peripheral</a>,
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x4003_0000</code> would map to our first <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">WB
Scope</a>).
This isn’t a bug, but it can be a rather surprising consequence
the address decoding algorithm.</p>

<p>So, all in all, we did okay here with our second attempt at address assignment.
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>, however,
has a better approach to generating a “partial address decoding” mask, which
we’ll discuss in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="autofpgas-address-assignment-algorithm">AutoFPGAs Address Assignment Algorithm</h2>

<p>What we’ve done above nearly describes
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>’s
address assignment algorithm.  There’s only one piece missing: minimizing
the required size of the mask.</p>

<p>To handle this,
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
takes a first pass through the peripheral list to
calculate the minimum total address size.  It then increases the minimum
peripheral address size as long as the total address width remains less
than the minimum address width, and as long as the number of mask
bits goes down.</p>

<p>How shall the minimum total address size be calculated?  Just the way we did
it in our last section: add peripherals to a bus and calculate the address
width.  The number of relevant bits is then given by the difference between
the full address size and the bloated minimum size given to every slave.</p>

<p>For example, if we look through our example slave set, you’ll see that the
maximum slave size that doesn’t increase increase the address width is 25 bits.
Once chosen, each slave is checked for its address size.  If the slaves
address size is less than 25 bits, it is replaced by 25 bits in the
algorithm above.  The algorithm then continues as before.</p>

<p>For the slave set example we’ve been working with today, the result then
looks like Fig. 10 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 10. Minimizing mask size for a given address width</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/address-assignment/final-assignment.png" alt="" width="589" /></td></tr></table>

<p>You might notice that the base address just increments from one peripheral
to the next–that’s the minimum address size amount.  Further, the peripheral’s
are just one step away from each other up until the last peripheral–the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">SDRAM</a> again.</p>

<p>Looking at Fig. 10 again, you’ll notice that the total address width is just
one more than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">SDRAM</a>’s
address width.  This is the minimum possible address width we could’ve
achieved.  Similarly, you’ll also notice that the address calculation now
fits in a 5-bit mask.  Since Xilinx chips allow packing two 5-LUTs into a
single 6-LUT as long as the wires are the same, that means we can do our
address decoding with only six pairs of 5-LUTs.</p>

<h2 id="bus-hierarchies">Bus Hierarchies</h2>

<p>This same basic approach maps quite nicely to bus hierarchies as well,
where one bus master is a slave to another bus above it.
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
handles bus hierarchies by simply walking the bus tree from the bottom on
up.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Start at the lowest bus in the hierarchy.  Assign addresses to it.
Once accomplished, you’ll then know the address width of this sub-bus
within the hierarchy.</p>

    <p>This width is used to fill key tags within an bus-translator or arbiter
components, allowing them to be adjusted for the width of the bus
they are working with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you then move up in the hierarchy, you can treat each bus beneath
as a self-contained slave.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Where this starts to get interesting is if you have multiple tops to the
bus tree, and those tops each have a different perspective of the
address map.  I’ve already had this problem once with both the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> and the
debugging bus
occupying the top of the tree.  My solution was rather hackish to force
a specific arrangment of the two buses, but I’m likely going to need to
revisit it in the future.</p>

<p>Since I’m only just now starting to handle multipl-masters with
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>, rather
than using an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/ex/wbarbiter.v">arbiter</a>
to neck down every bus to a single master, I’m not quite sure how this
is going to impact things … yet.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I’m sure there are more complicated address assignment algorithms out there,
but this one has worked rather nicely for me for some time.</p>

<p>It’s not perfect.  One of the particular limitations of this algorithm
as written is that it doesn’t (yet) handle the case where some peripherals
have pre-assigned addresses and others need to be assigned around those.
This means that every time your run
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
the address structure might change.  That’s not necessarily a good thing
when you’ve already delivered a product to your client and you just want
to add a new piece of hardware to the address decoder without obsoleting
all of the software you’ve already written.  In other words, allowing
the address space to be fixed is something I am very interested in
addressing in the future.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you have control over all of the parts of a project and
have no problems rebuilding all of your software on every reconfiguration, then
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
might be the solution you need.  Not only does it move things around, but it
then updates a series of header and data files that you can then use to keep
running the same software once recompiled.  As a result, if I simply run</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>make autodata
<span class="nv">$ </span>make</code></pre></figure>

<p>all of the addresses may get reassigned, but all of the software will rebuilt
at the same time to support the new address space.  On the other hand,
address reassignment isn’t automatic–if I don’t run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make autodata</code> then
the design should work as is with the current address assignments.</p>
