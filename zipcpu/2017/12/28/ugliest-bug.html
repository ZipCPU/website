    <p>I’ve been working with software most of my life–since long before I ever
went to <a href="https://wp.stolaf.edu">college</a>.  Now, after several decades of
working with software, I’d like to think I may have learned something about
fixing bugs in software.</p>

<p>I’ve learned to debug bugs by their patterns, and the more often I see the
same error lead to the same bug the more these patters are enforced in my mind.
Hence, any time the symptoms of a bug match a pattern I’ve seen before, I know
exactly where to look for the bug.  When younger programmers ask me why
their code isn’t working, I just match what’s going on to a pattern I’ve seen
in the past, and I can usually find any problem they might have quite quickly.</p>

<p>I’ve got to believe I’m not alone in this approach, and that others have also
used this approach to debugging software as well.</p>

<p>While this approach has served me well over time, there was one bug I
encountered recently that didn’t match <em>any</em> of the patterns I’ve learned over
my many decades.</p>

<h2 id="the-symptoms">The Symptoms</h2>

<p>Are you ready to see if you can recognize this bug?  Think you can do it?
Here’s what I was looking at.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1. Writing past the end of memory</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/past-end-of-memory.svg" alt="" width="320" /></td></tr></table>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The code crashed with a
  <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">bus error</a></em>,
created by trying to access a non-existent memory address using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a>.</p>

    <p>This isn’t the first time I’ve ever had a computer program do the wrong
thing.  As a result, I design my
<a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">wishbone interconnects</a>
to both return an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
upon any attempt to read from a non-existent address, as well as to
record the address created the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>.
For this reason, I knew the address the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">interconnect</a>
was seeing–and it was indeed beyond the end of memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you looked through and followed the code, there should never have been a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">bus error</a>.
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a> had put the proper logic into the
code to calculate the correct address.  For some reason, the correct
address wasn’t getting calculated.  Indeed, if you examined the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> state following the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">bus error</a>, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a> wasn’t
pointing to the right value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I used the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/08/25/hw-debugging.html">debugger</a>
to step through the code, there would be no error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any attempt to add a debugging statement prior to the bug would keep the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> from getting a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">bus error</a> at that instruction.</p>

    <p>This includes both the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BREAK</code> instruction as well any instructions which
might have been used to trigger the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my frustration at one point while I was trying to figure out what the
problem was, I decided to try Voodoo computing.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Defn: Voodoo computing, verb: The process of fixing what isn’t broken in
an attempt to fix what is.  It is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">Cargo
Cult</a> programming.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>So I restarted the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> from
the beginning of the program.  (This was a warm reboot, not a cold one from
no power.)  On this second program start, the code executed as designed and
the program failed elsewhere.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Confused yet?  I certainly was.  Let me show you what the code looked like.</p>

<h2 id="the-software-in-question">The Software in Question</h2>

<p>The code that failed was the very first function call following a reboot.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 2. Initial stack pointer</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/initial-stack-pointer.svg" alt="" width="240" /></td></tr></table>
<p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> would start
at the reset address and it would load the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a>
with a reference to the end of memory.  While both of these are configurable
addresses within the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> infrastructure, inspecting
the code confirmed that the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">assembler and
linker</a> had done their jobs correctly.
After a couple of other instructions upon
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> startup, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> would then jump to this
<code class="highlighter-rouge">first_subroutine</code> and quickly fail.</p>

<p>Here’s what those first few instructions looked like,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-assembly" data-lang="assembly">reset_address:
	; Load the stack pointer with the address of the very last location
	; in memory.  (LDI = load immediate, SP = stack pointer)
	LDI	#end_of_memory,SP
	; ... some other setup lines
	JSR	first_subroutine
	; ... code continues</code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">LDI</code> instruction within the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
can load an arbitrary value into any register over the course of up to two
instructions.  Specifically, it takes one instruction for anything up to
23-bits, and two instructions for anything longer.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3. The first Stack Frame</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/initial-stack-frame.svg" alt="" width="240" /></td></tr></table>
<p>The program then jumped to a subroutine.  This involves copying the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter">program counter</a>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">PC</code>, into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">R0</code> general purpose register, and then jumping to the address
given–in this case the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>
jumped to <code class="highlighter-rouge">first_subroutine</code>.  (I’ve since forgotten the subroutine’s actual
name.)</p>

<p>The first several instructions in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">first_subroutine</code> were much like any
other subroutine.  They created a stack frame by subtracting a value from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a>–adjusting
it to point earlier in memory.  This creates an area in memory where the
program can hold local variables, commonly called
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">stack frame</a>.  The program
then attempted to save some registers to this new
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">stack frame</a>.
In assembly, this looked like,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">first_subroutine:
	SUB	16,SP	; Create a stack fromm, subtracting 16 from SP
	SW	R0,(SP)	; Store R0 into the first position in the stack frame
	SW	R1,4(SP); BUS ERROR HERE!!!!</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’ve never seen
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
assembly before, it reads from left to right, with the destination of the
instruction on the right.  Hence <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUB 16,SP</code> subtracts sixteen from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a>
and places the result back into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a>.
Likewise <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW R0,(SP)</code> stores the value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">R0</code> into the address given by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a>,
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">SW R1,4(SP)</code> does roughly the same thing, with the
exception that <code class="highlighter-rouge">R1</code> is saved into the location four bytes later.  Of these
three instructions, only the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUB</code>tract instruction modifies the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a>.</p>

<p>If I pulled the code up in a
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/08/25/hw-debugging.html">debugger</a> following
this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">bus error</a>,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">SP</code>
would have the value given by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">end_of_memory</code> value it was initially
loaded with.  It was as though the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">stack frame</a>
was never created, despite the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUB 16,SP</code> instruction.</p>

<p>When the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> then tried to write into this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">stack frame</a>,
it would write past the end of memory.
Depending on whether <code class="highlighter-rouge">end_of_memory</code> pointed to the last address
in memory (where I commonly set it), or just past the end of memory would
then determine whether storing <code class="highlighter-rouge">R0</code> to the location in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a>
caused the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">bus error</a>
or whether it was storing <code class="highlighter-rouge">R1</code> to the location 4 bytes later
that caused the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">bus error</a>.
Either way, the code caused a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">bus error</a>
and none of it made any sense to me.</p>

<p>Before reading any further, think about the description above, and then ask
yourself: does this match any bug pattern you’ve ever seen before?  The program
fails the first time it is tried, but not the second–but then it would fail
on the third time.  Any attempt to add debugging code kept this error from
happening.</p>

<p>Oh, and let me give you a hint: I was running my own code, on my own
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>, within an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2 id="what-was-it">What was it?</h2>

<p>In many ways, I was at a loss to figure out the problem until I started
up the program in a <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">based</a>
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/07/26/cpu-sim-debugger.html">simulation</a>.
(Yes, I know, I was running code that I hadn’t <a href="/blog/2017/06/23/my-dbg-philosophy.html">simulated first</a>–<a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">shame
on me</a>.)  Once
I saw the bug take place within the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/07/26/cpu-sim-debugger.html">simulator</a>,
I knew I could find it quickly.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the problem lied in the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pfcache.v">prefetch and instruction cache
module</a>.  This
module was declaring that an
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/18/wb-prefetch.html">instruction was valid</a>
one clock cycle before the cache logic had finished writing that instruction
into the cache.  In this case, there was often a <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOOP</code> in the cache
instead of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUB 16,SP</code> instruction.  Hence, when the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> was erroneously given the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">NOOP</code> instruction, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack
pointer</a>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">SP</code>, remained where it was–pointing to the end of memory.  The subsequent
<code class="highlighter-rouge">SW</code> (store word) instruction then wrote past the end of memory, which then
triggered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">bus error</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to draw this in Fig 4 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4. Reading from the cache one clock too early</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ugliest-bug.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The figure shows a single
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache#CACHE-LINES">cache line</a>.  The
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pfcache.v">prefetch/i-cache</a>
module was filling that cache line with valid instructions.  It had filled
all but the last instruction, when it then declared the instruction was
valid.  Then, as it filled that last instruction with <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUB 16,SP</code>, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>
read the <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOOP</code> instruction that had been there one clock earlier, hence
leading to the bug.</p>

<p>Had the subroutine’s first instruction landed anywhere else in the cache line,
being one clock early wouldn’t have mattered–since those locations would’ve
already been filled by the cache logic at that point.  This particular location
in the cache line made this appear to be one of those “phantom” bugs–bugs
that manifest at some times but not at others.  It also made it harder to
discover–as discussed above.</p>

<p>So let’s go back through those symptoms and explain what happened, shall we?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We just explained why the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">bus error</a> took place–the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a> never
got updated, and so the program tried to write off the end of memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUB 16,SP</code> instruction was present in the code, the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pfcache.v">prefetch</a>
returned a no operation instruction (<code class="highlighter-rouge">NOOP</code>) to the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>,
so this subtract was never executed–leaving the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register">stack pointer</a> pointing
to the end of memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/zipcpu/2017/08/25/hw-debugging.html">debugger</a> never
had a problem because it it operated at a much slower speed than the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> was capable of operating.  This
gave the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> in single stepping
mode enough time to load the cache before trying to read from the last
address in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache#CACHE-LINES">cache line</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I placed another instruction anywhere before the subtract in the
program’s instruction stream, then the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUB 16,SP</code> instruction would no
longer be the last element in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache#CACHE-LINES">cache line</a>,
and there wouldn’t be any timing error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I restarted the computer after this failure, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUB 16,SP</code> instruction
would already be in the cache.  Hence, when the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pfcache.v">prefetch</a>
declared the instruction to be valid one clock too early, it would still
read what was in the cache from the last time, i.e. the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUB 16,SP</code>
instruction.</p>

    <p>That the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> then failed somewhere
else should come as no surprise, when there is a bug of this type within
its code.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This bug was so strange, and so different, that I though it would be fun to
share here.  I hope you enjoyed it.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>So what are some of the lessons I learned from this bug?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I learned the value of the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/07/26/cpu-sim-debugger.html">simulator</a>.
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">Traces</a>
taken using the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a>
just didn’t have enough information within them to permit me to recognize
the bug quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I (re)learned the fact that <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">not all test benches will
catch all bugs</a>..
This bug was not caught by my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/sim/verilator/pfcache_tb.cpp">prefetch testbench</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I learned to place several cache testing pieces of code into my
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sw/board/cputest.c">testing
program</a>.
As a result, were this bug ever to show again, I’d detect it early on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even after all of this, I never quite trusted my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pfcache.v">prefetch and cache
code</a>
until some time later when I formally proved that it worked.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps you’d like to see that formal proof?  I’d love to share it!  However,
that will have to wait for another day and another post.</p>
