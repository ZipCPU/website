    <p>You may have heard about
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.  Perhaps you’ve found it on
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">github</a>.  Perhaps you’ve read about it
on my <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> page.  Perhaps you had a
chance to hear me <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/blob/master/doc/orconf17.pdf">describe it
at</a>
<a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF, 2017</a> or looked over
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/blob/master/doc/orconf17.pdf">my slides</a>.
It only seems fitting that I should share it with my readers
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/">here</a> as well.</p>

<p>Today, therefore, I’d like to discuss why I created
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>, and some of the problems with
the alternatives.  I’ll briefly discuss the goals of
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>, and the license it is released
under.  When done, I’ll discuss a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga-demo">new
project</a> I just created based upon
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>, which I’m hoping to use in the
future to explain how
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> works.</p>

<h2 id="why-autofpga--the-backstory">Why AutoFPGA?  The backstory</h2>

<p>I started working on
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
after creating several independent
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> based projects, and getting
annoyed that it felt like I kept rebuilding the wheel.  Each project needed
to have a bus designed for it, it needed to have interrupts defined and
assigned, peripherals needed to be integrated, and all these things changed
from project to project.</p>

<p>Perhaps an overview of these projects might help make this clear.</p>

<p>The first <a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">wishbone</a> based project I
worked on was based around <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>’s
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">Basys3</a>
board.  You can see the basic outline of the project in Fig 1, from before
I added the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> to it.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1: Basys 3 design</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/basys3.svg" alt="Basys3 Design outline" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>My purpose was to learn about how to do hardware design <em>on my own</em>, without
the office support team that I had when I first started learning
hardware design.  You know, the difference between relying on the experience
of other members of your team, versus needing to have that experience yourself?</p>

<p>Since it was my first design as part of
<a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist Technology</a>,
there were a lot of new parts and pieces.  To highlight this new work, I’ve
outlined it in blue within Fig 1 above.  Basically everything was new.</p>

<p>It was on the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">Basys3</a>
that I first built a
<a href="https://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">flash controller</a>,
a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART</a>, a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA controller</a>, and much more.
Eventually, I built the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
on the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">Basys3</a>,
even though it’s not shown in Fig 1.</p>

<p>However, I wanted to try working on a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">project</a> that required an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
with a small form factor.  Previous designs I had worked on involved both a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>
and an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
working together, and I was curious to know if I could do all of the work
within a bigger
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>.</p>

<p>I considered the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod S6</a>,
but ultimately chose to try
<a href="http://www.xess.com">Xess.com</a>’s
<a href="http://www.xess.com/shop/product/xula2-lx25">XuLA2-LX25</a>
board. (I bought the <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod
S6</a>
later.)  The <a href="http://www.xess.com/shop/product/xula2-lx25">XuLA2-LX25</a>
had more capability, more logic within its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>,
had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital">SD card</a> socket, and
even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_dynamic_random-access_memory">SDRAM
memory</a>.
In the end,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">the design</a> looked something like Fig 2.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2: XuLA2 LX25 SoC Design</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/xula.svg" alt="XuLA2-LX25 SoC Design outline" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>You can still find the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">project
here</a>, should you be interested in it.
It does contain an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc/blob/master/rtl/sdspi.v">SD-Card controller</a>,
and an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc/blob/master/rtl/wbsdram.v">SDRAM
controller</a>.
You can see the other components of the design in Fig 2 above.
It was the first full project that I released under an open-source license.
(Unfortunately, it’s poorly documented, despite documentation existing for all
the components.)</p>

<p>The good news was that, when building the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">XuLA project</a>, I
was able to re-use a lot of the components I had initially built for
my <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">Basys3</a>.  Still, looking at the amount of stuff
in blue, there was still a lot of work involved in building the new design.</p>

<p>I also decided to toy around with the idea of seeing if I could
“broadcast” on a local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation">FM</a>
channel using the board, as I had <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/raspberry-pi-fm-transmitter">seen a friend
do</a> with
his <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>.  (It’s always fun to one-up
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> developer with
your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
design.) So, I created an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbfmtx">WB FM transmitter hack</a>.</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation">FM</a> transmission
approach worked like a charm, integrating it into
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">the project</a> on
a whim and then taking it out later was pretty annoying.  There was a lot
of work involved, and several files that needed to be changed, and did I get
it all done properly?  I think you get the idea.  If that wasn’t bad enough,
what if I wanted to try the design again later, or demonstrate it for others?</p>

<p>When it was time to move forward with my next design, I wanted to try building
something in an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>,
logic limited environment–just to prove that the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
would work on one of the <em>small architectures</em> it had been built for.
Could it really fit in the smallest
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
development board I could find?  So, I bought a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod
S6</a>
featuring a
Spartan 6LX4–the smallest
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
that <a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> sells in its the Spartan 6 line.
The challenge with this design was to make something <em>small</em>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3: S6-SoC Design</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/s6soc.svg" alt="Outline of the S6SoC" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">this project</a>, I was able to reuse a lot
of the components I had already built.  Looking in Fig 3, you’ll see only a
small amount of development outlined in blue.  The biggest challenge to the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">design</a> was both building the bus logic, and
keeping everything small.</p>

<p>This was also the first
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">project</a> I ever built with time-slicing,
but that’s another story.</p>

<p>Since I had never worked with
<a href="https://opencores.org/project,wbddr3">DDR3 SDRAM</a> before,
I chose to work with
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digitlent</a>’s
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/arty-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists/">Arty</a>
for my next project so that I might learn about it.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4: OpenArty Design Overview</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/openarty.svg" alt="Outline of the S6SoC" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The majority of the new work in this design was for the ethernet, the
<a href="https://opencores.org/project,wbddr3">DDR3 SDRAM</a> controller,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/wboled.v">OLEDrgb</a>,
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/busmaster.v">bus</a>
(<em>again</em>).  (Eventually, I had to shelve
<a href="https://opencores.org/project,wbddr3">DDR3 SDRAM</a> controller, choosing instead
to use a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip">Wishbone to AXI4 bridge</a>.
There was also a lot of work to raise the clock speed to 200MHz, but since
the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> MIG core could only run at 82MHz on the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/arty-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists/">Arty</a>,
this work was shelved.)</p>

<p>When it came time to build an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI video</a>
processor, I chose to use the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/">Nexys Video</a>.
By this point in time, I had finally had enough of rebuilding the wheel on
every design.</p>

<p>For every design up until that point, I had <em>hand-crafted</em> an interconnect to
connect all the components into the design.  (This is the horizontal blue line
in each of the figures above.)  This interconnect would connect
components to an internal <a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">Wishbone
bus</a>, and it would connect interrupts
together from the various peripheral components to one of a couple of interrupt
controllers.  You can see examples of my interconnects for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc/blob/master/rtl/busmaster.v">XuLA2-LX25
here</a>,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/rtl/busmaster.v">CMod S6 here</a>,
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/busmaster.v">Arty here</a>.
Addresses needed to be assigned, interrupts needed to be assigned,
they both needed to be documented, and these things were just taking too much
of my time.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, anytime I adjusted the number of addresses a specific
peripheral might require, I might need to adjust its location in the address
space I was creating.  This made for a lot of work.  As you may recall, I
like to access my designs via a <a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">bus based external controller from
software</a>,
and that <a href="/blog/2017/06/29/sw-dbg-interface.html">software needs to know where things are located on the
bus</a>.
The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> also needs to know not only
where things are located on the bus, but <em>if</em> particular peripherals are a
part of the design or not.</p>

<p>I’ve already discussed how annoying this was when (temporarily) integrating
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbfmtx">FM transmitter hack</a> into my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">XuLA2-LX25 SoC design</a>.</p>

<p>The need for a reconfiguration assistant also came up when I was working on my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI video</a> design.  At the time, I was
struggling to understand what was going on within my (broken)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI video</a> stream.  I had decided that
I needed to capture some of the video stream to block RAM via a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a>, after which I was going to
read the results back to find out what was going wrong with my design.  The
problem with this was that video is a memory hog.  Therefore, my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a> needed a large block RAM.
This meant that I needed to adjust the size of the block RAM that the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>
was using.  This necessitated changing the bus interconnect, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a> loader, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sw/board/board.ld">linker script</a>,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sim/verilated/main_tb.cpp">simulation
driver</a>
that will load the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>
into simulated memory, and more—and all of this just to
get the results of a one-time Video capture test.</p>

<p>This was why I wanted a capability like
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> simplifies the number of
changes that need to be made to a design when reconfiguring it, working
like a secretary (not a designer) to automatically connect things together,
and then let you know what it did.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-other-aggregators">Lessons from Other Aggregators</h2>

<p>I think <a href="/blog/2017/05/17/welcome.html">I’ve mentioned that I’ve spent a lot of time answering
questions</a> on
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>’s
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">forums</a>.
Many students will come to the <a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">forum</a>
declaring that they want to build a design
in <em><a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado</a></em>,
but what they really mean is that they want to build a design using the
graphical design method
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado</a> supports.
Interacting with these individuals has given me a lot of insight into the
problems many students are struggling with as they work to create (and debug)
their own designs.
From my standpoint, it seems like the biggest problem these new
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
students are struggling with <em>is</em> the graphical design flow that they are so
eager to learn.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The design flow <em>hides</em> a lot of configuration detail.  It allows you to
connect blocks together, but yet each block needs a lot of internal
configuration that isn’t immediately visible once configured.  It takes a
bit of digging to even get at this configuration information.</p>

    <p>As an example, I just recently helped one individual who was struggling to
get his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI video</a> data lined up with
his clock.  (He didn’t realize this was his problem until it was fixed.)
The particular configurations necessary were hidden within both
the SelectIO wizard and the clocking wizard, but neither wizard made the
users choices available upon a cursory view of the project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The design flows aren’t textual.  You can’t do a “diff” between two designs.</p>

    <p>This makes it hard to answer the question of “how is my design different
from the example/reference design.”</p>

    <p>Indeed, I was actually rather surprised, when I
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/blob/master/doc/orconf17.pdf">presented</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
at <a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a> this year
that I got cheers when I declared the whole processing flow to be
“textual”, and said that you could run it from within a
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Makefile</a>.  (The same audience groaned
during another presentation, when that presenter explained that his tool
<em>only</em> had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphical User Interface
(GUI)</a>.)</p>

    <p>I guess I hadn’t realized how much of a drag many of the modern graphical
tools were becoming to the professional designer.
This may be because
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a>s tend to
start up slowly.  It may be because
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a>s tend to
limit your design options to the
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/7/13">road most people travel upon</a>.
However, for me the problem is twofold:  First, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a>
forces me to slow down and use a mouse.  Second, building a design can take
a lot of work: I like the option of using
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a> to build <em>only</em> those portions
of the design that have changed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It isn’t clear how to place a scope or a probe into such a design, to see
and understand what is going on within it.  For example, if you have
component <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> connected to component <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>, and the output of component <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>
is somehow wrong, how shall you know which of the two is
misconfigured?</p>

    <p>Going back to the individual struggling to get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI video</a> working, he didn’t have
any clear locations within his design where he could <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">create a tap and
see the problem</a>.</p>

    <p>Sure, he could examine some wires via
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a>’s
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/ila.html">ILA</a>,
but what if you need to create an ad-hoc computer program to comprehend
the output of the scope?  It wasn’t clear how to do this with the
proprietary
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/ila.html">ILA</a>.
Without it, it wasn’t clear how to identify where in the
processing chain the problem was at.</p>

    <p>This, by the way, is one of the reasons that Open Source
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">scopes</a> are so necessary: their measured
output values can easily be ingested into your own specialized debugging
software to be processed as you see fit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one time, when I asked some other users about graphical design methods,
an online acquaintance noted that there doesn’t seem to be any way to “take
the training wheels off” of these methods, so as to be able to dig down
into the nuts and bolts of a design once you were ready to do so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> toolchain in particular has
created a horrendous problem for
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>’s support staff, in that every
new version of
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado</a> breaks
their demonstration projects.</p>

    <p>I’m not sure if this is because they rebuild or reconfigure their component
libraries from  one version to the next, or if it is because they rebuild
their TCL scripting interface, or what.  Indeed, I’ve
struggled with the problem myself when I tried rebuilding my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty</a> design with a newer version
of <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado</a>.
The result of my effort was an error so obscure that not even the
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> support staff on <a href="https://forums.xilinx.com">their
forum</a> could identify.  (This is why you won’t
find any of the
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado</a>
output files/products in the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty</a> repository.)</p>

    <p>As a result, <a href="/digilent/2017/05/18/most-common-digilent-support-requests.html">I watch students</a>
on the <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">forum</a> struggling to build the example
designs provided for them unless they have the exact same version of
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado</a>.
Indeed, telling the student which version of
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado</a> to use
to build an example/demo is a <a href="/digilent/2017/05/18/most-common-digilent-support-requests.html">common Digilent support request
response</a>.</p>

    <p>Wouldn’t you rather be able to separate your component library updates
from your tool updates, so that what works with one tool will work
with others?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All of this leads me to the conclusion that, if I wanted to create an
alternative, it would need to be OpenSource, and it would need to not take
any of the design decisions away from the designer: all of the Verilog files
would need to be available for view.</p>

<p>Indeed, I wanted something that would generate Verilog (and c++, and Make)
project files that I could then inspect and understand–not something that
would hide details that would become difficult to debug later.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any design flow or tool suite that hides “useless” or “irrelevant” details
will also hide the location of your bug.  (<a href="https://twitter.com/zipcpu">ZipCPU tweet</a>)</p>

<h2 id="autofpgas-design-goals">AutoFPGA’s Design Goals</h2>

<p>My goal for
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
was simple: to be able to run
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
with a list of peripherals, and have it automatically connect those
peripherals together in a manner prescribed by their configuration files.
Indeed, if you look in an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga-demo/blob/master/auto-data/Makefile">example
Makefile</a>
that calls
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>,
you’ll find a line that just calls
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
with a list of components.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">autofpga global.txt bkram.txt buserr.txt clock.txt hexbus.txt		<span class="se">\</span>
	fixdata.txt pwrcount.txt rawreg.txt simhalt.txt	version.txt spio.txt</code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a>“able</p>

    <p>To keep things simple, I’d like to type
“<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make">make</a>” in a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga-demo/blob/master/Makefile">top level
directory</a>,
have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make">make</a>
recurse as necessary into any sub-directories to process <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga-demo/tree/master/auto-data/">component
configuration
files</a>, build
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga-demo/tree/master/auto-generated/">design files</a>,
assemble those files together, and build a project all from one
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make">make</a> command.</p>

    <p>Okay, so … I don’t know how to do this with the proprietary vendor based
tools (yet), and I don’t want to use a broken Tcl toolflow, but I do know
how to do this much with both
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">yosys</a>
and
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.</p>

    <p>(No, I’m not saying that Tcl is broken, but rather that many of the tools
that use it are–for the reasons discussed above.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No new language</p>

    <p>Further, I don’t really want to create a new language for component
interaction and connection.  While I understand that other tools exist,
such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP-XACT">IP-XACT</a>,
<a href="https://myhdl.org">MyHDL</a>, or
<a href="https://github.com/m-labs/migen">Migen</a>, I didn’t want to require the
developer to learn a knew language (XML, Python,
<a href="https://github.com/m-labs/migen/blob/master/fhdl.rst">FHDL</a>, etc.)
in order to interact with
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.  I also didn’t want to build
a compiler.  I wanted
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> to be a
product that I could use to create a production system, and I
didn’t want to slow down too much to get there.</p>

    <p>For this reason,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> is primarily a
Copy and Paste utility.  The configuration files will identify what
things need to be copied and pasted where to create the desired output
files.  As an example, a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/auto-data/flash.txt">Quad SPI flash
component</a>
doesn’t just need to connect to a
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">wishbone bus</a>, it also needs a little
bit of tri-state code inserted at the top design level.  (It’s actually worse:
since the flash clock line is shared with the load circuitry, a special
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STARTUPE2</code> component is often required
at the top design level as
well.)</p>

    <p>I’ll need to leave it open for debate as to whether or not I created a
“new language”, since the configuration files are neither Verilog nor are
they C++, and they are definitely not Python.  Instead, the files consist
of a simple series of “@KEY=VALUE” pairs, where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VALUE</code>s can take
multiple lines–often containing pieces of Verilog or C++ code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No hidden design components</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> just creates text files.
Since
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> is primarily a copy and
paste utility, comments within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> configuration files will just
get copied into their respective places.</p>

    <p>What this means is, when you have a problem with the design of one of your
components, you can look back into that components configuration file and
see what got copied and adjust it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While I like to think that
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
has met all of these goals and more, I’ll leave it to you and time to be the
ultimate judge.</p>

<h2 id="license">License</h2>

<p>If you are wondering if you can legally use
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> for your project, the answer is
that you can.  <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> is a software
program licensed under the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPLv3</a>.  If you make changes to it,
or improve it, I would love to have those changes returned to the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> repository for others to use.</p>

<p>This license doesn’t cover <em>your</em> intellectual property, only the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> program itself.  Indeed, I
consider <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
to be a piece of software similar to a compiler.  As a result,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> asserts no particular license
on the files it creates, or the projects that use it.</p>

<p>Going one step further, all of my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> projects specify their own
license.  What I mean is that I require
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> created design files to have
a license statement within them.  The license statement chosen if specified
by the global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@LEGAL</code> tag, such as you might find in one of my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga-demo/blob/master/auto-data/global.txt">global configuration file</a>s.
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> then copies <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga-demo/blob/master/auto-data/legalgen.txt">this
license</a>
into the files it generates–adjusting the filename and project name as
appropriate.  Hence while <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
is released under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPLv3</a>, I can choose
to release (or not) any project that uses it.  Feel free to adjust the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@LEGAL</code>
tag to reference the license appropriate for your project.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-autofpga-design">A Simple AutoFPGA Design</h2>

<p>Given all of that as background, I’d like to spend some time introducing
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
and discussing how to add (or remove) peripherals to(/from) a project.
I’ve created a new project,
an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga-demo">AutoFPGA Demo</a>, which contains
a series of simple peripherals that can easily become a part of any project
using <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.  This should be
simple enough for any new student to learn how to build and integrate
components together using
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.</p>

<p>I have more complicated demonstrations as well, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic">ZBasic</a> project.
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic">ZBasic</a> contains a basic
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>, together with some simple
peripherals and several bus structures.  Once we exhaust the lessons from the
basic <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga-demo">AutoFPGA Demo</a> project,
we may turn there for some more examples to draw demonstrations from.</p>

<p>We’ll use <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga-demo">this example project</a>
project, as a demonstration over the next couple of posts, showing what can be
done with <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.</p>
