  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Vitalrnixofnutrients">[Vitalrnixofnutrients]</a> recently
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZipCPU/comments/m7hqe7/where_is_the_source_code_for_zipos/">asked on the ZipCPU Reddit page</a>, whatever happened to the
ZipOS?  Or, more specifically, “Where is the source code for ZipOS”?</p>

<p>That’s a good question, and worthy of a blog post in its own right.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/tree/master/sw/zipos">ZipOS</a> was an
“Operating System” of my own design (if you can even call it that) that I
then used on the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/tree/master/sw/zipos/">S6SoC
project</a>
to demonstrate the multiple tasking capability of the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.
As demonstrated, it consisted of a couple of small but primary components.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There was the O/S Kernel.  You can find an example of it here for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/tree/master/sw/zipos/">S6SoC
project</a>.  The key to
getting it to operate in real time for the doorbell application of the S6SoC
project was to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/cmodram.ld">split the
kernel</a> into
both <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c">realtime</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/ksetup.c">non-realtime</a>
components.</p>

    <p>The real-time
“<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c">kernel</a>”,
such as it was, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/doorbell.c#L196-L238">required all tasks to be loaded and defined at build
time</a>.  It wasn’t very generic, in that you couldn’t start a new
task at a later time.  Worse, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/taskp.c#L45-L59">you had to know the stack
size</a>
required of all of the tasks at build time as well.  That was always a key
limitation whenever I wanted to use it for a new project.</p>

    <p>Part of the problem was due to my (non-existent) <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/ksetup.c#L122-L125">malloc
implementation</a>
at the time.  It worked great, as long as you never wanted to “free” any
memory.</p>

    <p>Did I say “real-time”?  What made this kernel
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c">this kernel</a>
“real-time” wasn’t anything more than the fact that it met its realtime
requirements.  I managed that by placing the real-time critical parts of the
system into RAM, and leaving the rest running from Flash.  (RAM was a <em>very
precious</em> resource on the S6, since there was only ever 16kB of block RAM
and no off chip RAM.)  Putting software into RAM was therefore a big deal,
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/03/21/dblfetch.html">but given how slow the flash
operated</a>, it was a
necessity.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second key component of the ZipOS was the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/syspipe.c">System Pipe architecture,
syspipe</a>.
This was a piece I was particularly proud of, in that it was a
multiprocessing O/S component that could be shared across all user tasks.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/syspipe.c">SysPipe
component</a>
allowed one process to write into it, and another process to read out of it.
In many ways, this was a basic AXI-stream protocol – just written in
software.  If the wasn’t enough space within it to write, the writing task
would either block or raise an error flag (and cause a panic if I recall
correctly).  Reads were similar.  If there wasn’t enough used memory within
the pipe, the pipe would block until another task filled it with sufficient
memory.</p>

    <p>Indeed, the pipe task was kind of unique, in that while one process wrote
into the pipe, another process might try reading from it, and the second
process would then block until the write was finished–meaning that “two
threads” might be active with the pipe at the same time, even though only
one thread would ever actually be active while the other one was blocking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A third piece was the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/traps.h">traps (i.e. syscalls) that were
defined</a>.
Do note the key word in that statement: “defined.”  Not all of the defined
traps were implemented.  For example, there were traps for getting and
returning semaphores that were never implemented in the Kernel.</p>

    <p>The kernel implemented the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c#L270-L289">WAIT</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c#L290-L307">CLEAR</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c#L308-L311">POST</a> software interrupt,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c#L312-L314">YIELD</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c#L315-L326">READ</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c#L327-L339">WRITE</a>,
get <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c#L340-L342">TIME</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c#L343-L345">MALLOC</a>,
(ignored) <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c#L346-L349">FREE</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/zipos/kernel.c#L350-L355">EXIT</a>
system calls (traps).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the big components of the ZipOS.</p>

<p>Development stalled, however, when I tried to make the ZipOS more generic.
In many ways, this reveals how far the ZipOS was from a general purpose
Operating System.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the all tasks, and their stack sizes and pipe connections,
all needed to be known at startup didn’t bode well for larger or more
generic systems.</p>

    <p>Frankly, this was quite cumbersome to work with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lack of a good free() system call meant that all memory was once allocated
and never released.  While this might be great for a small, embedded
task managing system that only ever had 16kB of RAM, it was never generic
enough to be used in a system that would start new tasks after it had started.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wasn’t just tasks that were the problem.  At the time, I didn’t have a good
means of adding and removing new devices into the O/S.  The methods I had
weren’t generic enough to easily move on to the next project.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, rather than fixing the ZipOS, I’ve been spending my time fixing the
foundations that made the ZipOS difficult to work with.</p>

<h2 id="autofpga">AutoFPGA</h2>

<p>One of the bigger problems was the challenge of <a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">building a bus interconnect for
a design</a>.  It
seems like every design I use has a different set of peripherals, and they all
get <a href="/zipcpu/2019/09/03/address-assignment.html">mapped to new addresses with every new
project</a>.  It’s
not just the addresses that get remapped from one FPGA design to another, the
interrupts get remapped as well.</p>

<p>I needed a means of generating a design, connecting all the peripherals, and
providing an address mapping from the FPGA design portion to the software
that was controlling it.  This became the project
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.  You can read an <a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">overview of
the project here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="malloc">Malloc</h2>

<p>A second big problem I had was the lack of a good memory allocation scheme.
Anyone who has studied memory allocation will know this is a field of study
in and of itself.  I needed to fix the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">malloc()</code> issue, but didn’t want to get
stuck in a lifetime of studying memory allocation to come up with the perfect
memory allocator.</p>

<p>My solution was to adapt <a href="http://sourceware.org/newlib/">NEWLIB</a> for the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.
Most of my projects today now use this <a href="http://sourceware.org/newlib/">NEWLIB</a>
port.  The <a href="http://sourceware.org/newlib/">NEWLIB</a> port is now a part of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU repository</a>, and these
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/02/12/zbasic-intro.html">ZBasic</a> instructions
should be enough to get you started with it.</p>

<h2 id="disk-drive">Disk Drive</h2>

<p>A second big problem with the ZipOS was that it didn’t have any support for a
disk drive or other non-volatile storage of any type.  Sure, I had my
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash</a> controller,
but this worked better as a ROM than a disk-drive which could hold any type of
file system.</p>

<p>This was fixed in <a href="/blog/2019/11/14/sdspi.html">one of my recent SONAR
projects</a>.  In that project, my
customer didn’t have a Linux setup.  He couldn’t load software onto the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> in my usual <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus
fashion</a>.  Worse,
without the debugging bus, I couldn’t really load a bootloader design <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">into the
flash</a>.  I needed a new way
of delivering software to him.</p>

<p>My solution was to use my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDSPI SD-Card
controller</a> together with the
<a href="http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html">FATFS library</a>.  I placed the
bootloader for this project into RAM, and then used it to read a file from the
SD-Card into memory which would then be the program file that my customer then
ran.</p>

<p>The pieces from this solution can be found in a couple of places.  First, the
files that made my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDSPI controller</a> work with
<a href="http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html">FATFS</a> are posted in the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi/tree/master/sw">software
directory of the
SDSPI controller</a> controller.
Many of the other pieces are hidden in the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/tree/dev">dev branch of my videozip
project</a>.  While I’d like to move
them out of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/tree/dev">dev branch</a> and
into the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/tree/master">master branch</a>,
that’ll require pulling the board out and making sure they work within that
project again–something I haven’t (yet) had the opportunity to do.</p>

<p>Sadly, the size of the initial required boot loader means that it won’t fit in
the block RAM of the smaller FPGAs I have.  Those will still need to have their
initial bootloader initially loaded into flash.  Other than that problem, they
should work quite nicely.</p>

<h2 id="the-memory-management-unit">The Memory Management Unit</h2>

<p>That gets us past most of the problems with the original ZipOS, but without
a Memory Management Unit (MMU) I’ll struggle to allocate new tasks at runtime.</p>

<p>One solution, similar to the one I used in the original ZipOS, would be to give
every task its own stack and memory area.  In this case, I would again need to
know how much to give each task at allocation time.  I suppose I could give a
generous amount to each task, but this would only work if I had a generous
amount of RAM to give to every task.</p>

<p>The second problem with the solution above was that there was no way to tell
if a task overran its memory area, nor was there a means of allocating more
memory to a task if it had done so.</p>

<p>Both of these problems can be solved by adding an MMU to the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1. The original ZipCPU MMU-is-a-peripheral design forced the caches to operate on virtual addresses</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/zipos/original-mmu.svg" alt="" width="560" /></td></tr></table>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">I have built such an
MMU</a>.
It has yet to be successfully integrated into the CPU.  Well, I shouldn’t quite
say it like that.  I did manage to get the CPU to build (once) with the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">MMU</a>
attached, but then ran into the problem where I needed a test program to test
out and try this
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">MMU</a>
and that’s where the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">MMU</a>
project ran out of steam.  I just … wasn’t certain what kind of program to
write in order to exercise it well.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should ask my <a href="https://reddit.com/r/ZipCPU">Reddit</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/ZipCPU">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://parler.com/ZipCPU">Parler</a>
followers for suggestions the next time?</p>

<p>The second problem the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">MMU</a>
had was that the caches operated on Virtual memory addresses within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">MMU</a>
boundary.
In other words, the caches would only ever know virtual memory addresses.
Worse, a piece of memory in the cache might get overwritten by a second
virtual memory address to the same physical memory address if ever a single
physical memory address existed in two virtual memory places.  Worse,
addresses had context associated with them that would also need to be checked
and … I never managed to come up with an acceptable solution at the time to
fix this problem.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 2. A proposed MMU alternative, so that the caches operate on physical addresses</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/zipos/proposed-mmu.svg" alt="" width="560" /></td></tr></table>

<p>With a bit of hind sight, I now understand more of MMU design.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">MMU I
built</a>
was a fully associative MMU–requiring much more logic than was really required.
I’m tempted, now, to take another start at the MMU and to place it between the
CPU and its caches.  I’m also tempted to build the TLB within the MMU as a
one-way cache rather than a fully associative one, but I haven’t put my hand
to that task yet, because of the next task I’ve been working on which has
really taken precedence for me.</p>

<h2 id="bus-agnosticism">Bus Agnosticism</h2>

<p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>,
as originally designed and built, is tightly coupled to a
pipelined implementation of the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone bus</a>.  The last
couple of projects I’ve worked on, however, have required an AXI3 bus not a
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone bus</a>.
My most recent work, therefore, has been to make the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
bus agnostic so that it can be used with both a
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>
or an AXI4 bus.  (If you build the master right, then converting from AXI3 to
AXI4 and back becomes easy.  The key trick is for the master to only use one
AXI ID to solve the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WID</code> problem and then to avoid issuing any burst
requests longer than 16 beats.)</p>

<p>I’ve therefore been rebuilding the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
since last fall to be bus agnostic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There’s now a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/zipcore.v">ZipCore</a>,
containing the core of the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
and exposing a custom interface to both instruction and data memory units 
which can now be external to this core.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now have instruction fetch routines for AXI4.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilfetch.v">basic fetch routines
are in this AXILFETCH file</a>,
and include a single instruction fetch (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FETCH_LIMIT=1</code>),
a dual instruction fetch (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FETCH_LIMIT=2</code>), and even a full instruction fetch
pipeline and FIFO (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FETCH_LIMIT &gt; 2</code>).  There’s even now an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axiicache.v">AXI4 instruction
cache</a>
implementation that mimics <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pfcache.v">my original Wishbone pipelined instruction cache
implementation</a>–although
the updated CPU is still missing a full AXI4 wrapper.  There is, however, an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/zipaxil.v">AXI4-lite wrapper</a>
that I’d like to try out in the near future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also have new data routines supporting AXI4.  These include the basic
one-operation <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilops.v">AXILOPS</a>,
as well as the multiple memory access
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilops.v">AXILPIPE</a>
design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m also working on an AXI data cache.  I expect it will be very similar to
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/dcache.v">my original Wishbone data
cache</a>, but
it’s still a work in progress and hasn’t (yet) been posted.  I’m still hoping
to <a href="/zipcpu/2019/02/09/cpu-blinky.html">outperform Microblaze again</a>
but this time using AXI4 either with (<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilops.v">or
without</a>)
the data cache.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That leaves the issue of atomic accesses when using AXI4, something the AXI4
specification calls “exclusive access”.</p>

    <p>This last weekend, I worked on and posted an updated <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/demofull.v">AXI block RAM
controller</a>,
which, unlike Xilinx’s block RAM controller, can actually handle exclusive
access.  (Yes, I would like to blog about this soon …)  A CPU requires
atomic access support from its bus in order to make an operating system
work, and when using the AXI4 bus that support needs to come from the
slave–and not so much the bus.  Therefore, I now have a slave which can
offer this support.  That may even keep the CPU from needing a trap to
handle semaphore’s in the future.</p>

    <p>The key step to making this task happen was updating my AXI4 (full) properties
to fully check the exclusive access handshake.  Much to my surprise (not),
several bus components stopped working now that the exclusive properties
are being fully tested–with the key failing component being the
<a href="/formal/2020/05/16/firewall.html">AXI4 firewall</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exclusive access when using AXI4 requires a bit of a change to
interface the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/zipcore.v">CPU
core</a> with
its memory modules.</p>

    <p>AXI4 exclusive access works in two steps, four from the standpoint of the CPU.
1) The CPU receives a LOCK instruction, warning it that an exclusive access
request is coming.  2) The first instruction following the LOCK request is a
read, which then sets the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARLOCK</code> field in an AXI4 (not lite) memory
request.  3) Once the value is read, the CPU operates on it–however it
needs to.  In the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s atomic access scheme, there’s
only one ALU instruction allowed here–sufficient for most operations.
4) The value is then written back to memory using a request with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AWLOCK</code> set.  If all goes well, the slave responds with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXOKAY</code>
response.  If, however, something else has accessed the memory between
the original read and this final write, the slave is required not to write
the value to memory and to instead return an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OKAY</code> response.  This needs to
then trigger the CPU to go back and re-start the operation from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOCK</code>
instruction.</p>

    <p>I have most of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilops.v">basic AXI-lite memory
unit</a>
converted to a version that now uses this exclusive access mechanism,
however that has meant that I’ve needed to change the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/bench/formal/fmem.v">memory interface
properties</a>
used to verify the other memory routines and so those other routines now need
to be reverified together with the 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/zipcore.v">CPU core</a>
(again).</p>

    <p>I still need to modify the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/zipcore.v">CPU core</a>
to handle the re-start part of the operation as well.  I’m hoping this can
be as simple as the memory unit reading into the program counter register,
but I haven’t checked that part either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I haven’t (yet) resolved how to make the bus and CPU endian-agnostic.
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>
doesn’t require any particular endian requirement, although the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> is big endian by nature.
AXI4 on the other hand is very definitely little endian in spite of what the
specification says.  Perhaps you may recall <a href="/blog/2020/01/13/reuse.html">discussing this issue
before</a>?  Swapping endianness
isn’t nearly as trivial as it sounds.
I’m expecting this
issue to rear its head once I try to start using these routines–which should
be in the next couple of months.  Indeed, I’m already aware of some bugs
that may need to be addressed early on.</p>

    <p>In preparation for this, I’ve made modifications to both the compiler and
binutils to handle building the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/01/31/cpu-build.html">tool chain</a>
for either endianness.  I have yet to test these modifications.  Depending on
what happens when I try out my bus-based hacks, I may or may not need to
continue with updating the tool chain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
for another bus also requires another wrapper, so I now have an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpuc/blob/zipcore/rtl/zipaxil.v">AXI-lite
wrapper for the ZipCPU to test
out</a>.  Unlike
my previous wrappers, this one is now formally verified (and I’ve discovered
bugs in the previous wrappers in the process–so I’ll now be formally
verfiying all my wrappers).  That means there’s now a new
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpuc/blob/zipcore/rtl/zipbones.v">ZipBones</a>
wrapper, and a (work in progress) updated
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpuc/blob/zipcore/rtl/zipsystem.v">ZipSystem</a>
wrapper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m also moving around the control register address allocation for the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.  Previously,
the debugging interface required two interactions to read a register.
1) First, you’d need to write to the CPU debug control register to set the
register address of the register you wanted to inspect, and then 2) you’d
need to read the data value from the CPU data register.  This required
two round trips across the bus.  This process then needed to be
repeated for every register within the CPU to just display the debug
screen.  Because this involved both writing and then reading, the debugging
bus was never able to use its burst access capability.  On a bad day, the
operation could be painfully slow.  I’m therefore allocating addresses for
every register in the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s register, so that you can
read all registers with one group-read command.  This should drastically
improve the performance of the debugger when reading registers across a slow
serial port–a long needed change.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bus-width-adjustments">Bus Width Adjustments</h2>

<p>All of the above bus agnostic work is designed to make the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> work on an
AXI4 bus.  The project that needs it, however, involves connecting the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> to a controller that originally
had two 32-bit AXI3 bus ports.  One of those ports, that of an AXI3 DMA, now
needs to be made to be 64-bits wide.  Indeed, the whole core bus infrastructure
of that project will require a bus whose (minimum) size is 64-bits or this
DMA will have to run in a crippled fashion.  This has left me with some
problems–now resolved below.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging
bus</a> I use has
only ever been 32-bits.</p>

    <p>I now have an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilupsz.v">AXI-lite bus
upsizer</a> which
should work nicely for this debugging interface, so that can now issue
read or write requests on any AXI4( or lite) bus that’s at least 32-bits
wide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s original
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>
memory modules, both instruction and data, were only ever
32-bits.  This was always a sore point when working with a 64-bit wide
DDR3 SDRAM memory, such as the one the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">Arty
A7</a> has, since the memory device could
read twice as fast as the CPU could ever receive the results.  Sure, my
<a href="/blog/2020/03/23/wbm2axisp.html">Wishbone to AXI</a>
bridge “works” and works nicely, but half the bandwidth
of the memory was lost in the 32-bit to 64-bit conversion.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s new AXI4 memory
modules can now be parameterized by bus width, so they should be able to
handle an arbitrary sized memory bus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That still leaves me with a 64-bit bus needing to control a 32-bit
peripheral.</p>

    <p>To handle that problem, I recently built a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axi2axilsub.v">64-bit to 32-bit AXI4
downsizer</a>.
This appears to work in initial formal testing, but the design hasn’t yet
passed either an induction check or any simulation.  That’ll be coming soon.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Indeed, this project is now getting much closer to testing.  I’m expecting to
have the project, with the updated
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
in test before this summer time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>No, the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> project
hasn’t stalled.  It’s still going strong.  However, while I’ve made many of
the changes above, they’re still waiting on some simulation tests to shake out
the last bugs remaining in them.  Until that happens, I’m not likely going to
merge the new <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/tree/zipcore">zipcore
branch</a> into the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/tree/master">master</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the ZipOS project itself has stalled.  However, it’s now being given
the foundations it was missing from the beginning.  It’s my hope, therefore,
that when I return to it I’ll be able to make much more progress on it than
ever before.</p>
