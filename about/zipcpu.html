<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> built for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
environments by <a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist Technology, LLC</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> was initially designed with the
sole purpose of creating a simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>
within an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>,
and particularly one that was powerful enough to run Linux.</p>

<p>In bullets, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A 32-bit CPU.  All registers are 32-bits wide, addresses are 32-bits wide,
instructions are 32-bits wide, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC CPU</a>.
It implements only a minimum set of instructions, a much smaller set than
most other “RISC” CPU’s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load/store_architecture">Load/Store

load and store instructions can access memory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone compliant</a>.  All
peripherals are accessed via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_mapped_I/O">memory mapped

<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone bus</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von-Neumann architecture</a>.  Both instructions and data share a common bus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipline_(computing)">pipelined architecture</a>,
having stages for <em>prefetch</em>, <em>decode</em>, <em>read-operand</em>, <em>execute</em>, and
<em>write-back</em>.  The <em>execute</em> stage is implemented by one of
four blocks: an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/cpuops.v">arithmetic logic unit
(ALU)</a>, a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pipemem.v">memory
unit</a>, a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/div.v">divide
coprocessor</a>,
and a (not yet implemented) floating point coprocessor.  The last two blocks,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/div.v">divide</a> and
floating point coprocessor, will only ever be options to the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">CPU</a>.  Their inclusion will be chosen
based upon your implementation needs.</p>

therefore trade LUTs for speed if desired.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="low-cost">Low Cost</h2>

<p>The ZipCPU was designed to be implemented on a low cost FPGA board.
Reasons for this include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I couldn’t afford the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
board that I really wanted, the
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-v7-vc707-g.html">VC707</a>,
much less the license I would need to program it.
Instead, I could afford the much smaller boards ($50-$150), such as the
ones <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a> sells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to know how to build a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>.
This includes learning how to build not only a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>, but also
backends for
<a href="https://sourceware.org/newlib">the C-library</a>, 
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a> and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils">binutils</a>
(<a href="https://www.gnu.org/s/gdb">GDB</a> soon to come).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to purchasing any boards or licenses, I simulated my designs
using <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.  However,
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> only works with
Verilog source, not encrypted proprietary IP components.  Hence, when I
wanted to simulate <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">an FFT</a> with
neither hardware nor proprietary IP, I was forced to
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">build my own</a>.  The same became true
for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>.  Incidentally, the
“simulate before you buy” technique worked so well for <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users">my first
board</a>,
that I had my initial design running within two days after I received the
board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m still hoping to integrate an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">optional
MMU</a>
into <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">the CPU</a>, and with it to run Linux,
but this feature remains sometime in the future.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="unique-features-of-the-zipcpu">Unique Features of the ZipCPU</h2>

<p>While the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> was the result of my own
desire to learn how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>’s operate, now
that it has been built it solves many of the problems that many of the more
proprietary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>’s
struggle with.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Because the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> is completely open
source, <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">opensource tools</a>
may be used to simulate and run the CPU–even without an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>.</p>

    <p>o Your simulation CPU’s power is the limit of this simulation.  As an
 example, you could, if you wished to, run the
 <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">CMod-S6</a>
 <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sim/verilator/zip_sim.cpp">simulation</a>
 all the way from power up through several rounds of
 <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/tttt">4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe</a>.  (Just don’t run it in
 debug mode all night, at the peril of filling up your disk drive.)</p>

    <p>o In a similar fashion, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> is not
 tied to <a href="https:www.altera.com">Altera</a>, <a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a>, nor
 <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">its more recent port</a> to the
 <a href="https://www.latticesemi.com">Lattice</a> iCE40
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>’s.</p>

    <p>o Hence, it offers more flexibility than either
  <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/microblaze.html">MicroBlaze</a>
  or <a href="https://www.altera.com/products/processors/overview.html">Nios2</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> was designed to be
simple, it can be <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">a component</a>
on a very small
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>,
such as the Spartan 6LX4 used in the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent’s</a>
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod S6</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU">ZipCPU</a> was designed around the
pipelined <a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone bus</a>, found
within the <a href="http://opencores.org/cdn/downloads/wbspec_b4.pdf">Wishbone B4
specification</a>,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> enjoys memory accesses that
are between three and thirty times faster than the
<a href="https://openrisc.io">OpenRISC</a> core.  (Their cache
implementation is still better than mine, though …)  Further, because of
the many, many options and channels required in order to implement the
<a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI bus</a> used by
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a>’s IP, the
<a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a> is simpler and hence both
easier to work with, and it requires less logic to use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist Technology,
LLC</a>, owns all of the
code for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU">ZipCPU</a> and its peripherals,
proprietary licenses may be purchased.  This sets the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> apart from the other OpenSource
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_microprocessor">soft core CPUs</a>, such as
<a href="https://openrisc.io">OpenRISC</a>, whose IP may
not be owned by any single entity with whom one might negotiate a purchase.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out many of the details of this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> repository on
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.  There, you will find the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/doc/spec.pdf">specification for the
CPU</a>
which contains not only the obligatory description of its instruction set, but
also examples of how to program with it as well as my ongoing
“honest assessment” of it as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="example-zipcpu-designs">Example ZipCPU designs</h2>

<p>In many ways, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> is just that: a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> and only a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>. 
It has a connection to its memory and peripherals, but these are not a
part of the ZipCPU itself.</p>

<p>However, <a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist
Technology</a> has publicly
released several designs that use
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>, all available on
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU">GitHub</a> for you to examine.  These include the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</a> project, which
fits on the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> Spartan-6LX4 found within a
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a> <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod
S6</a>,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty</a> which fits on a
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/arty-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists/">Arty</a>,
or the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">xulalx25soc</a> which fits on
<a href="https://xess.com">Xess.com</a>’s
<a href="https://xess.com/shop/product/xula2-lx25/">XuLA2-LX25</a> board.  Upon customer
request, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">xulalx25soc</a> now has a
build option which can be used to build a version for the Spartan-6LX9 found
on the XuLA2-LX9 board which <a href="https://xess.com">Xess.com</a> used to sell.</p>

<p>Another ZipCPU design you may wish to look at is the 
basic ZipCPU design called <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic">zbasic</a>.
This design has support for a flash, block RAM, and a serial port.  It’s also
my testing grounds for getting the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SD Card
controller</a> to work.</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> has undergone several instruction
set revisions, going from a four bit opcode supporting only 32-bit bytes, to a
five bit opcode, and finally to a 5-bit opcode with support for 16-bit
compressed instructions and 8-bit bytes.  I see no reason at this time to
adjust the instruction set any more.</p>

<p>The current instruction set has newlib, GCC, and binutils support–although the
soft floating point emulation support is lagging a touch.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/tree/master/sw/zipos">minimal O/S</a> exists
for the ZipCPU.  Further O/S support is expected, but lagging behind getting
more peripheral support.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Here’s a summary of the clock rates the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>
can achieve on a variety of commercial boards:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">XuLA design</a> was used in the summer
of 2016 to benchmark the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> using
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone">Dhrystone benchmark</a>.  At the
time, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> only supported 32-bit
bytes, so it wasn’t 
a proper fit for
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone">Dhrystone benchmark</a>.
Still, it was able to accomplish <strong>0.744 DMIPS/MHz</strong> packing one character
in each 32-bit byte.  If you instead packed four characters into the 32-bit
bytes used by the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> at the time,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">CPU</a> could achieve
<strong>0.95 (modified) DMIPS/MHz</strong>. 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/doc/orconf.pdf">These results</a>
were presented at ORCONF, 2016.</p>

<p>Since then, the CPU has been modified to support 8-bit bytes.  I have not
returned to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone">Dhrystone benchmark</a>,
though, to update its performance measure.</p>

<p>As of ORCONF, 2016, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> used between
1286 and 4926 6-LUTs, depending upon how it is configured.  This number is out
of date, though, for the same reason that
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone">Dhrystone benchmark</a>
measure is out of date: the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> has
since been modified to support 8-bit bytes.  I can say, though, that I was
able to pack more logic into the CMod-S6 as a result than I could pack into it
before, suggesting that the new and improved CPU uses even fewer resources.</p>
