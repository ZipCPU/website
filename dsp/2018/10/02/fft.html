    <p>Have you ever tried to simulate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">DSP</a> algorithm using <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>, only to
then realize that your design required an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
and that all you had was a proprietary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
implementation?  Perhaps you
then looked for open source alternatives among the <a href="https://opencores.org/projects?expanded=DSP core">DSP
cores</a> on
<a href="https://opencores.org">OpenCores</a>, only to find that the particular
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
size you needed wasn’t supported, or that it required more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a>s
than your board had?  Perhaps the open core you found didn’t work, and you
were unable to either verify the core by re-running the formal verification
or by running the test bench.</p>

<p>This happened to me when I set out to build one of my first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> designs: a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a> processing algorithm.  However, in my case, things were worse.  I needed an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
that could process two incoming samples per clock, or I would have
no chance of applying my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a>
processing algorithm in real time.</p>

<p>Since building this core, I’ve discovered how universally applicable an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
core is.  As a result, I’ve expanded the initial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
capability that I had built in order to handle some of the
more common use cases.  Not only does this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
process a high speed input at
two samples per clock, but it can now handle the typical case of one input
sample per clock, or even half or a third of that rate.  Part of my hope
with this change is to be able to easily process audio samples at rates
much slower than the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
<a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">pipeline</a>
can handle.</p>

<p>Why not implement a block
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
then?  That’s a good question.  For now, my simple is simply
one project at a time.</p>

<p>Today, I’d like to introduce <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this FFT core
generator</a>, show you how to generate
a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/tree/master/rtl">custom FFT core</a>
for your own purposes, and then discuss how I’ve gone about
formally verifying the components of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">the core</a>.
Yes, it has been formally verified–at least, most of it has.  But I’ll get
to that in a moment.</p>

<p>If you aren’t familiar with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a>, then you
should know that it is a very important part of <em>many</em> engineering applications.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>s are
an important part of any digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_analyzer">spectrum
analyzer</a>.
You’re likely to find one of these in just about any good electronics lab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>s can
also be used when implementing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a>, such as the
one shown in Fig 1. on the right, or Fig 2 below.  Such
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a>s make
it easier to understand artifacts of speech and other sounds, or even
radio frequency waveforms, by visual inspection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">convolutions</a> and/or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation">correlations</a> can often be
implemented much faster and cheaper using an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> implementation
of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a>.</p>

    <p>This means that <a href="/dsp/2017/11/04/genfil-tb.html">digital
filters</a> can be
implemented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a>
enabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">convolutions</a>
faster/better/cheaper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a>
are used to understand and analyze <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system">control
systems</a>.</p>

    <p>I was personally surprised at how easy it became to study and understand
a <a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">PLL</a>s implementation
once <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phaselock-Techniques-Floyd-M-Gardner/dp/0471430633/">Gardner rewrote
it</a>
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform">Z-transform</a>, a
variant of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifth, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a>s
are used not only in <a href="/dsp/2017/11/04/genfil-tb.html">filter</a>
implementations, but they are also used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks-McClellan_filter_design_algorithm">filter
design</a>
process.  We’ve
<a href="/dsp/2017/11/04/genfil-tb.html">discussed this somewhat</a>
already.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, just like you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a> to evaluate
<a href="/dsp/2017/11/04/genfil-tb.html">filter</a>
implementations, you can also use them to <a href="/dsp/2018/01/16/interpolation-is-convolution.html">evaluate and compare interpolator
implementations</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Indeed, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">transform</a>
is so ubiquitous in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">digital signal
processing</a>
that it can be hard to avoid: it is the <a href="/dsp/2017/11/22/fltr-response.html"><em>natural way of expressing a signal
or linear operation in a time-independent fashion</em></a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left"><caption>Fig 2. An FSK decomposed with FFT based processing</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/fft-fsk.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform"><em>Fast</em> Fourier
Transform (FFT)</a>
is a specific implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a>, that drastically
reduces the cost of implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a> Prior to the
invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">Discrete Fourier
transform</a> could only
be calculated the hard way with <code class="highlighter-rouge">N^2</code> multiplication operations per transform
of <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> points.  Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm">Cooley and
Tukey</a>
<a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1965-19-090/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1.pdf">published</a>
their algorithmic implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">Discrete Fourier
transform</a>,
they can now be calculated with <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(N log_2(N))</code> multiplies.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the invention of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> immediately
started to transform
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">signal processing</a>.
But let’s back up and understand a little more about what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a> is first.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a> is
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map">linear operator</a> that decomposes
a signal from a representation in time, to a time-less representation in
frequency.  This is done via a continuous-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra)">projection
operator</a>
applied across all time to an incoming signal,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_operator)">projecting</a>
the incoming signal onto a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_formula">complex
exponential</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_function">basis
functions</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-fourier-transform.png" alt="" width="280" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This is the definition you will first come across when studying
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a>.
This form above is easy to work with mathematically with
just pen and paper–as long as you don’t try to calculate the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a>
of <code class="highlighter-rouge">e^{j 2pi ft}</code> across all time–something which only
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function">questionably converges</a>.</p>

<p>There are two problems with this nice mathematical definition when it comes
to working with an engineering reality.</p>

<p>The first problem is that digital algorithms don’t operate upon continuous
signals very well.  Computers and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">digital signal
processors</a>
do a much better job with
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sampled</a></em>
signals.  Hence, we’ll switch from discussing the
pure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a> shown above and examine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_Fourier_transform">Discrete-time Fourier
transform</a>
instead.  For this, we’ll switch from a continuous incoming signal,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">x(t)</code>, to its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sampled</a>
representation, <code class="highlighter-rouge">x[n]</code>.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_Fourier_transform">Discrete-time Fourier
transform</a>
can then be applied to our signal.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-discrete-fourier.png" alt="" width="327" /></td></tr></table>

<p>While this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_Fourier_transform">discrete-time
transform</a>
works very nicely for representing the response of certain
<a href="/dsp/2017/11/22/fltr-response.html">digital filters</a>,
it’s still not all that practical.</p>

<p>This brings us to the second problem: Computers can’t handle an infinite
number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>,
nor can they handle an infinite number potential frequencies.  Both of these
need to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sampled</a>
and finite.</p>

<p>Fixing this second problem brings us to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">Discrete Fourier
transform</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-fast-dft.png" alt="" width="291" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Now, not only is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">x[n]</code> used in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">this transform</a>
discrete, but the frequency index, <code class="highlighter-rouge">k/N</code>, is as well.</p>

<p>All three of these representations are very tightly related.  Indeed, it can
be argued that under certain conditions, such as those of a sufficiently
band limited and time limited signal, each of these three operators
can be said to be roughly equivalent.</p>

<p>Ouch.  Did I just say that?  The
mathematician within me is screaming that this statement is in gross error.
Mathematically, there are major and significant differences between these
transforms.  Practically, however, only this last transform can ever be
computed digitally.  Therefore, the first two expressions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a> and then the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_Fourier_transform">discrete time Fourier
transform</a>
can only ever be digitally approximated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">Discrete Fourier
transform</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should just leave this point by saying these three representations
are tightly related.</p>

<p>It is this third representation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a>, known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">Discrete
Fourier transform</a>,
that we’ll be discussing the implementation of today.  I’m also going to argue
that this is the only representation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier
transform</a>
that can be numerically computed for any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sampled</a> finite
sequence, but I’ll be glad to invite you to prove me wrong.</p>

<p>If you look at the form above, you can see it takes as input <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> data
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">x[n]</code>,
and calculates one summation across those inputs for every value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">k</code> to
produce <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
out, <code class="highlighter-rouge">X[k/N]</code>.  Given that there’s a complex multiplication
required for every term in that summation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> numbers, and that there are
<code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> relevant outputs, this will cost <code class="highlighter-rouge">N^2</code> painful multiplications to calculate.</p>

<p>If we just left things there,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">this transform</a>,
would be so hard to calculate that no one would ever use it.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm">Cooley and
Tukey</a>,
however, described a way that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">Discrete Fourier
transform</a>
can be decomposed into two transforms, each of them being half the size of
the original, for the cost of only <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> multiplies.  If you then repeat this
<code class="highlighter-rouge">log_2(N)</code> times, you’ll get to a one point transform, for a total cost of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">N log_2(N)</code> multiplies.  At this cost point, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">Discrete Fourier
transform</a>
becomes relevant.  Indeed, it becomes a significant and fundamental
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">DSP</a> operation.</p>

<p>Let’s take a moment to scratch the surface of how this is done, using the
“decimation in frequency” approach to decomposing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
that is used within
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this core</a>.  It involves first
splitting the summation into two parts, one containing the low numbered
terms and one containing the higher numbered terms.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-dft-bisum.png" alt="" width="566" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The left term captures the first half of the summation, whereas the right term
captures the second half.</p>

<p>If you look at the two summation terms above, you’ll see that they share a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_formula">complex exponential</a>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">e^{-j2pi kn/N}</code>.  We can factor this common term out to the right.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-dft-subfft.png" alt="" width="537" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Once factored, this almost looks like the same summation we started with, only
in a recursive form.  The difference is that we are now calculating a smaller
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">Discrete Fourier
transform</a>, summing
over only half as many points as before.  The big difference is a subtle
modification to the inside.</p>

<p>To draw this out, let us consider even and odd frequency bins, <code class="highlighter-rouge">2k</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">2k+1</code>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-dif-prebutterfly.png" alt="" width="711" /></td></tr></table>

<p>We can simplify this further by the simple fact that <code class="highlighter-rouge">e</code> raised to any
integer multiple of <code class="highlighter-rouge">2pi</code> will be one.  Similarly, <code class="highlighter-rouge">e</code> raised to any odd
integer multiple of <code class="highlighter-rouge">pi</code> will be negative one.  This allows just a touch more
simplification.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-dif-butterfly.png" alt="" width="681" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This means that with just a little bit of manipulation, we can split the
calculation of one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">Discrete Fourier
transform</a>
into the calculation of two similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">Discrete Fourier
transform</a>,
each that are only half the size of the original.</p>

<p>The frequency independent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_formula">complex
number</a> in the second line,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">e^{-j 2pi n/N}</code> is commonly known as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle factor</a>.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/tree/master/rtl">generated
pipeline FFT</a> will
use a lookup table to avoid the need to calculate this on the fly.</p>

<p>Reducing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> by
pairs of frequencies in this fashion is accomplished via what’s called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_diagram">butterfly</a>.  In the code
we’ll discuss below, we’ll use the term <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/tree/master/rtl"><code class="highlighter-rouge">FFT
stage</code></a> to reference
decomposing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> into
two smaller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>s,
and we’ll call the calculation of the values within the parenthesis above
a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/hwbfly.v"><code class="highlighter-rouge">butterfly</code></a>.</p>

<p>I said I was going to gloss over the gory details, so I’ll start doing so here.
These details are readily available to anyone who wishes to look them up.</p>

<p>However, there is one important detail associated with which
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_diagram">butterflies</a>
are applied to that I don’t want to skip.  From the equations above, you can
see that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_diagram">butterfly</a>
will be applied to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">n+N/2</code>.  What’s not so obvious is that we can then repeat
this same decomposition using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">n+N/4</code>, and we can then repeat the decomposition again.</p>

<p>The other important detail in this process is that the result will be produced
in a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit-reversal_permutation">bit-reversed</a></em>
order.  You can see some of that above.  Notice how the values <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">n+N/2</code>
were used to calculate frequencies <code class="highlighter-rouge">2k</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">2k+1</code>.</p>

<p>Well come back to some of these details in a bit when we discuss how
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this core</a>
was verified.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-core-generator">Running the Core Generator</h2>

<p>If you want to try out the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">core
generator</a>, you’ll need to download and
build it first:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft
<span class="gp">$ </span>make</code></pre></figure>

<p>I like to think that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">the project</a>
doesn’t have any dependencies.  It would be more realistic to point out that
it depends upon <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc">GCC</a> (or other C compiler),
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">binutils</a>,
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>, and a
basic Linux environment.  (This is currently necessary for creating
directories, etc.)  The various bench tests currently require
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>,
though some require <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>
as well, and the formal proofs of the various components require
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>
and both the
<a href="http://yices.csl.sri.com">yices</a> and
<a href="https://boolector.github.io">boolector</a>
engines.  Neither
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>,
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>,
nor <a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>
or the formal engines, are required to use the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">core
generator</a>, however.  Feel free to
correct me if there’s anything I’m missing here.</p>

<p>Once the “<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>” command completes, you
should have an <code class="highlighter-rouge">fftgen</code> program in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sw/</code> subdirectory within the core.
That’s what we’ll be working with.</p>

<p>Need an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>?  Let’s get
started using <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this coregen</a>!</p>

<p>Suppose you want a 128-pt
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.  You can
simply run</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>./fftgen -f 128</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will create a directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">fft-core</code>, into which it will place the Verilog
code for this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>, and
the various hex files for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle
factor</a>s.</p>

<p>Of course, in any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>,
bit size is closely related to <a href="/blog/2017/06/12/minimizing-luts.html">logic
usage</a> within
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/tree/master/rtl">the core</a>,
and so it can be very important to control bit size.  The example above will
create an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> with a
default input bit-width of 16-bits per input.  Not only that, but this width
will grow at one bit for every two stages.</p>

<p>Would you rather have an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> with a 12-bit
input width?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>./fftgen -f 128 -n 12</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will create a 128-pt
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
with 12-bit inputs and 16-bit outputs.</p>

<p>What if you only wanted a 12-bit output?  You could limit the internal bit
growth, and hence the output size, to only 12-bits by adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">-m 12</code> to your
command line.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>./fftgen -f 128 -n 12 -m 12</code></pre></figure>

<p>By default, this will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle
factor</a>s
(constant approximations of those
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_formula">complex exponential</a>s)
of 12-bits–the same size as the input bit width.</p>

<p>What if that’s not enough?  An
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle factor</a>s
the same width as the data will suffer from some amount of <a href="/dsp/2017/09/27/quantization.html">truncation
error</a>.  We can
increase the number of bits used by these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle
factor</a>s to help reduce this
<a href="/dsp/2017/09/27/quantization.html">truncation error</a>.
Let’s increase them by making them two bits longer than the data at every stage.
To do this, we’ll add <code class="highlighter-rouge">-x 2</code> to our command line.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>./fftgen -f 128 -n 12 -m 12 -x 2</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will reduce the <a href="/dsp/2017/09/27/quantization.html">internal truncation
error</a> associated with
calculating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.
This <a href="/dsp/2017/09/27/quantization.html">truncation error</a>
will decrease until about <code class="highlighter-rouge">-x 4</code> or so, after which adding additional bits
bits is not likely to yield any significant additional improvements.</p>

<p>Voila!  A wonderful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>!</p>

<p>Well, not quite.  The big problem with this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
is that we’ve used <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">hand-generated shift-add multiplication
logic</a> for
many stages.  These soft-multiplies are expensive, and may well consume all
of the logic within your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>.
If you are instead using an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> that
provides hardware accelerated multiplies (i.e.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a> elements),
then you can authorize the core to use some limited number of these
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a> elements.</p>

<p>For example, let’s build an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
using no more than 15
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a> by adding
<code class="highlighter-rouge">-p 15</code> to our command line.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>./fftgen -f 128 -n 12 -m 12 -x 2 -p 15</code></pre></figure>

<p>At this point, all of the multiplies within five of the seven stages of our
128-pt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> will now use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">hardware multipliers</a>,
at three multiplies per stage.  The last two stages don’t use any multiplies,
since they can be accomplished simply using additions and subtractions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your signal will come into the core at no more than one
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a>
every other clock cycle, then you can drop the number of multiplies
used per stage from three down to two.</p>

<p>This is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-k</code> parameter.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">-k 2</code> will cause the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
to assume that you’ll never give it two
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
on adjacent clocks.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>./fftgen -f 128 -n 12 -m 12 -x 2 -p 15 -k 2</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will now use <code class="highlighter-rouge">2(N-2)</code> multiplies for a <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^N</code> point
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>, of which
no more than 15 of these (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-p 15</code>) will use your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a> elements.</p>

<p>Need to use fewer
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a> elements?
Suppose no more than every third value required
a multiply?  Then we could do <code class="highlighter-rouge">-k 3</code>, and use no more than one multiply per
stage.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">$ </span>./fftgen -f 128 -n 12 -m 12 -x 2 -p 15 -k 3</code></pre></figure>

<p>This could be very valuable when processing an audio signal, for example, that
only ever has less than one
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a>
every thousand clock ticks.</p>

<p>Other options of interest include <code class="highlighter-rouge">-i</code> to generate an inverse
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> (conjugates the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle factor</a>s),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">-2</code> to generate an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
that can ingest two
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
per clock, and so on.</p>

<p>Indeed, you can just run <code class="highlighter-rouge">fftgen -h</code> to get a list of all of the options <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this
FFT core generator</a> will support.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./fftgen -h
USAGE:	fftgen [-f &lt;size&gt;] [-d dir] [-c cbits] [-n nbits] [-m mxbits] [-s]
	-1	Build a normal FFT, running at one clock per complex sample, or
		(for a real FFT) at one clock per two real input samples.
	-a &lt;hdrname&gt;  Create a header of information describing the built-in
		parameters, useful for module-level testing with Verilator
	-c &lt;cbits&gt;	Causes all internal complex coefficients to be
		longer than the corresponding data bits, to help avoid
		coefficient truncation errors.  The default is 4 bits longer
		than the data bits.
	-d &lt;dir&gt;  Places all of the generated verilog files into &lt;dir&gt;.
		The default is a subdirectory of the current directory
		named fft-core.
	-f &lt;size&gt;  Sets the size of the FFT as the number of complex

		a required parameter.)
	-i	An inverse FFT, meaning that the coefficients are

		coefficients given by e^{ -j 2 pi k/N n }.
	-k #	Sets # clocks per sample, used to minimize multiplies.  Also
		sets one sample in per i_ce clock (opt -1)
	-m &lt;mxbits&gt;	Sets the maximum bit width that the FFT should ever
		produce.  Internal values greater than this value will be
		truncated to this value.  (The default value grows the input

	-n &lt;nbits&gt;	Sets the bitwidth for values coming into the (i)FFT.
		The default is 16 bits input for each component of the two
		complex values into the FFT.
	-p &lt;nmpy&gt;  Sets the number of hardware multiplies (DSPs) to use, versus
		shift-add emulation.  The default is not to use any hardware
		multipliers.
	-s	Skip the final bit reversal stage.  This is useful in
		algorithms that need to apply a filter without needing to do
		bin shifting, as these algorithms can, with this option, just
		multiply by a bit reversed correlation sequence and then
		inverse FFT the (still bit reversed) result.  (You would need
		a decimation in time inverse to do this, which this program does
		not yet provide.)
	-S	Include the final bit reversal stage (default).
	-x &lt;xtrabits&gt;	Use this many extra bits internally, before any final
		rounding or truncation of the answer to the final number of

<p>I’ll admit this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">FFT generator
project</a> remains a bit of a work
in progress, there’s just so much more I’d like to do!  For example, it
currently only calculates a complex
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.  There’s a
real-to-complex stage that needs to be implemented in order to do real
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>s.  I’d also like
to implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm">decimation in
time</a>
algorithm, since having both will allow me to (optionally, under some
pass-through implementations) remove the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/bitreverse.v">bit reversal
stage</a>.
Eventually, I’d love to build a block processing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> as well.
All of these items are on my to-do list for
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/tree/master/rtl">this core</a>,
they just haven’t been done yet.</p>

<p>Still, it currently works as advertised.  Care to try it?</p>

<h2 id="interfacing-with-the-fft-core">Interfacing with the FFT Core</h2>

<p>Once you’ve generated an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>,
it’s then time to try it out.  To do that, you’ll need to connect it up to
your design.  The generated core has a couple of basic input ports, shown
below and in Fig 3.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="n">fftmain</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="o">,</span>
		<span class="n">i_sample</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">o_result</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">o_sync</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3. Basic Pipelined FFT Ports</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/fft-ports.svg" alt="" width="320" /></td></tr></table>

<p>These basic ports are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">i_clk</code> should be self explanatory.  This core consists of synchronous logic
only, and everything is synchronous to the clock input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">i_reset</code> is a positive edge synchronous reset signal.  If you would rather
an asynchronous reset, there’s a <code class="highlighter-rouge">-A</code> option to generate logic using
asynchronous negative edge resets.  However, since I tend not to use them,
I haven’t tested this option much.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> is a global CE signal.  It is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> on every clock where a valid
new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a>
is available on the input.  It’s very useful for processing signal
that may be at a rate slower than the system clock, such as <a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">we discussed
some time
ago</a>.
Once <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_sync</code> becomes true, one data
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a>
will come out of the core and be valid on every clock cycle that
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> is high.</p>

    <p>If you use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-k 2</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">-k 3</code> options, you’ll need to guarantee that
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> is never true twice in two
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
or twice in three
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
respectively, to allow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> a chance to compute the data.</p>

    <p>While this breaks the <a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">assumptions I described earlier for the global CE
signal</a>,
specifically that nothing should act if <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> is false, doing so allows the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> to share multiplication elements when possible.</p>

    <p>One final note here: if you want or need to control when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> starts
processing, or specifically which
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a> is the
first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a> of
the frame, you can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_reset</code> input for that purpose.  The first
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a> value
where <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> is true and <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_reset</code> is false will be the first value into
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">i_sample</code> is actually a pair of values, both real and imaginary, stuffed
into one signal bus.  The real portion is placed in the upper bits, and the
imaginary portion is placed in the lower or least significant bits.  Both
values are in traditional twos complement format, just stuffed together into
a single input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">o_result</code> is the output of one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> bin from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.  It is in the exact
same format as <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_sample</code>, save only that the output bit-widths used in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">o_result</code> may be different from the input bit-widths used in <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_sample</code>.</p>

    <p>If you can’t remember what bitwidths the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> was generated for, just check
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">IWIDTH</code> (input width) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">OWIDTH</code> (output width) local parameters in
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/fftmain.v">main, or toplevel, FFT core
file</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">o_sync</code> is the last output in the port list.  This signal will be true
when <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_result</code> contains the first output bin coming out of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.  This will be
the zero frequency bin.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_sync</code> signal is provided to allow any
following logic to synchronize to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> frame structure.</p>

    <p>The core does not produce an input synchronization signal to signal the first
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a>
of the frame.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the core is configured to handle two
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
per clock, the data ports and port names are subtly adjusted.  The new
ports are:</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 24px"><caption>Fig 4. Pipelined FFT Ports, two samples per clock</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/fft-dblports.svg" alt="" width="320" /></td></tr></table>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">i_left</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_right</code> replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_sample</code> when/if you want an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> that processes two
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
per clock.  They have the same format as <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_sample</code>.
The difference is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_left</code> is processed as though it came before
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i_right</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">o_left</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_right</code> are the output values that replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_result</code>.
As with the two-sample per clock <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> inputs, <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_left</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_right</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">o_left</code> is the “first” output of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_right</code> is the second
one.  Hence, if you include the bit reversal step then <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_left</code> will
refer to an even output bin, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_right</code> will only ever carry information
for odd output bins.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The particular core generated by <code class="highlighter-rouge">fftgen</code> is a
<a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">pipeline</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>, rather than a
block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.  This means
that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> is always
busy after accepting the first
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a>.
Once the first <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_sync</code> is true, then
valid data is coming out of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.  On every
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a>
thereafter where <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> is true, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
will produce another output
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a>.</p>

<p>You may be familiar with another
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> implementation,
that of a block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
implementation.  In a block
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>, a single block of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
would be provided to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> engine, after which
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> engine would
become busy and not accept any other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>.  Once a
block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> finishes
processing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
given to it, then it becomes ready for a second block.  As a
result, a block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> may
have other external signals beyond the ones shown above.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> implementation
I am discussing today, however, is only a straight
<a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">pipeline</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.</p>

<h2 id="verifying-an-fft">Verifying an FFT</h2>

<p>This blog <a href="/about/about.html">remains dedicated</a> to keeping
students out of <a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>.
So, how did I make certain that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this FFT
implementation</a> worked?</p>

<p>Let me begin by saying that
“<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>”
gains a new meaning when working with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>s are difficult
to understand internally, particularly because it can be difficult to validate
the data midway through.  Yes, I’ve written multiple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
implementations, both in software and now in hardware.  Yes, I’ve gone through
the mathematics.  That doesn’t mean they are simple.  Even with full access
to every internal signal within an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
they can still be a bear to debug.  Indeed, I still get surprised at the end
of this rather complex transform when signals suddenly pass through it properly.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve said all that, it should come as no surprise that debugging the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> is really a story
in itself.  Let me try telling what I can of it.</p>

<p>When I first built the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>,
it was to support a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a> processing
accelerator.  I had a hard time limit that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> needed to meet,
or the accelerated operation wouldn’t meet real time requirements.  I became
concerned during this process that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> wouldn’t be
fast enough, so I built an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> that could process
two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">samples</a>
per clock.</p>

<p>To verify this initial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>, I created <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/tree/master/bench/cpp">test
benches</a>
for all of the components.  The test bench would work by running data
through each component of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.  At the same time,
I would double check the output values within the C++ driver of my various
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/tree/master/bench/cpp">test benches</a>.
At first, the data was carefully chosen to find specific potential flaws
within the various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
components.  Later tests then threw random data through the component(s) to
prove their functionality.</p>

<p>Perhaps walking through an example might help explain this.</p>

<h3 id="initial-butterfly-verification">Initial Butterfly Verification</h3>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 5. A Decimation in Frequency Butterfly</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/fft-butterfly.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>As an example of this initial functional verification method, let’s consider the
implementation of the butterfly shown on the right.  This should look
familiar to you, as we discussed the equation for this earlier.  It’s
known as a “radix-2” decimation in frequency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> butterfly, and it’s a
primary component within the design.  Indeed, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> is formed around
calculating this operation repeatedly.</p>

<p>If we let</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-dft-twiddle.png" alt="W = e^{-j2pi n/N}" width="145" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Then we can represent this butterfly as,</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-dft-butterfly-implementation.png" alt="" width="217" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Where <code class="highlighter-rouge">x0</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x1</code> are <em>complex</em> inputs to the butterfly, <code class="highlighter-rouge">W</code> is a complex
exponential constant coefficient, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y0</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y1</code> are complex outputs.</p>

<p>We can break this operation down further, and write</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-dft-butterfly-real.png" alt="" width="347" /></td></tr></table>

<p>If this looks complicated while reading it, relax.  It’s much more complicated
in its actual implementation.</p>

<p>There are several problems with implementing this equation that aren’t
immediately apparent from just reading it.  The least of these problems are the
four multiplies.  Because multiplication is so expensive, I used a three
multiply alternative in the actual implementation.  But I digress.</p>

<p>Originally, the test bench would just create one line of text output per clock.
This line would include the time step, then the inputs to the module, and
finally the outputs from the module–all on the same line.  Sometimes, I’d even
place intermediate values on the line as well.  The trick to making this work
was to halt as soon as an invalid value was returned from the core, so that
value could be examined.  The disadvantage with this approach is that there
are only so many values that can fit on a line that can be reasonably
comprehended.</p>

<p>Eventually, I enabled <a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">VCD file</a>
generation as well, and then began examining output files via
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>
in addition to the textual output.</p>

<p>To test the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">butterfly
module</a>, I
provided initial inputs where all values but one were zero.  I then provided
inputs to
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">this module</a>
where the coefficients were plus or minus one or plus or minus Pi.</p>

<p>To verify the proper functionality of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">butterfly</a>,
I repeated the calculation within C++ inside my
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a> <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/butterfly_tb.cpp">test
bench</a>.
I then judged that, if the two matched, then the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">butterfly</a>
worked.</p>

<p>Once I tested all of the basic inputs outlined above, I then moved on to
throwing random values at the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">butterfly</a>
to “prove” that it worked.  In reality,
this approach never “proved” anything, but it does help to provide some
assurance.  Eventually, I modified the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">butterfly</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/butterfly_tb.cpp">test bench</a>
so that it would
completely exhaust the entire space of possibilities.  Be aware, though, such
an exhaust can send massive amounts of text to your output stream, and fill
up 42GB (or more) of <a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">VCD trace
files</a>.</p>

<p>The annoying problem with this approach to debugging is the sheer size of the
data that needs to be searched through and processed once a bug is detected.
A recent run, as an example, generated 42GB of
<a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">VCD data</a>.
Ouch!  That can be hard to process with
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>,
and generating file size that large has been known to impact the user
response time of my computer.  I know I’ve wondered at times if my CPU needs to
be given a hard reset, or just left to continue.</p>

<p>Still, this is a good example of how <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this FFT
core</a> was originally tested.  Indeed,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/tree/master/bench/cpp">these bench tests</a>
remain within <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">the repository</a>.
There are test benches for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/butterfly_tb.cpp">regular
butterflies</a>,
for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/hwbfly_tb.cpp">hardware assisted
butterflies</a>
(those using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a>s),
for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/fftstage_tb.cpp">basic FFT radix-2
stages</a>,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/qtrstage_tb.cpp">penultimate FFT
stage</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/butterfly_tb.cpp">final FFT
stage</a>.
There’s also a test bench for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/bitreverse_tb.cpp">bit reversal
stage</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/fft_tb.cpp">FFT as a
whole</a>.
These <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/tree/master/bench/cpp">test benches</a>
still work, and they are available for inspection and test within <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">the
repository</a>.</p>

<h3 id="making-the-fft-general-purpose">Making the FFT General Purpose</h3>

<p>Recently, I came back to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this FFT core
generator</a> to see if I could make turn it
into a general purpose
<a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">pipelined</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>, instead of one
that could only operate in a two-sample per clock mode.  Two big things
changed in this process.</p>

<p>First, in hind sight, I realized many of the “special modules” of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
could be parameterized into a few simple Verilog modules.  For example, the
2048 point radix-2 stage was fundamentally identical to the 64-point radix-2
stage with only a few differences that could be captured by parameters.<br />
Likewise, the inverse
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
code was identical to the forward
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> code, save
only that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle factor</a>s
needed to be conjugated.  In the end, only the top level component and the
coefficient files truly needed the core generator approach.</p>

<p>The second big change was that I wanted to support three versions of all of the
butterflies, both <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">the one using the soft
multiplies</a>
and the one using the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/hwbfly.v">hard
multiplies</a>.
I needed one version of each that would handle one operation
per clock, one that would multiplex the three multiplies across two
multiplication elements, and a third implementation that would multiplex the
three multiplies across three multiplication elements.</p>

<p>There were other minor changes as well.  For example, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/bitreverse.v">bit reversal
stage</a>
needed to be rewritten to handle one value per clock, as did the
final radix-2 stage of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.  Further, the
core components had initially been written without setting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">default_nettype</code>
to <code class="highlighter-rouge">none</code>, and without using <code class="highlighter-rouge">verilator -Wall</code>.</p>

<p>As a result, the minor change of adding support for three types of single
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)">sample</a>
at a time streams turned into a major rewrite of the entire
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.</p>

<p>That also meant that everything needed to be reverified.  Test benches
needed to be updated and … searching through GB of files for bugs that
might or might not show up was becoming <em>really</em> annoying.</p>

<p>So, I switched to using
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
to verify this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>.
Once I had proved that the simple modules of <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">the
FFT</a> worked, there were only a few
modules left.  That’s when it became personal: would it be possible to
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verify</a> the
entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>?</p>

<p>Hold that thought.</p>

<p>For now, let’s walk through a quick discussion of how each section was verified.</p>

<h4 id="bit-reversal">Bit-Reversal</h4>

<p>The bit reversal stage works by first writing a full
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> output into a piece
of block RAM memory.  When the second
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> output starts
coming into <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/bitreverse.v">the bit-reversal
core</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/bitreverse.v">the
core</a>
then switches to writing this new
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> into a second
block RAM area.  Then as more data comes in,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/bitreverse.v">the core</a>
ping-pongs between the two sections of memory.</p>

<p>Now, at the same time the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/bitreverse.v">bit reversal
stage</a>
is writing incoming data into one memory area, it is also reading out
from the other memory in a bit-reversed order.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 6. The bit-reversal stage</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/fft-bitreverse.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>To formally verify the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/bitreverse.v">bit reversal
stage</a>,
I let the formal tool pick an
arbitrary address (and memory area) , and then applied the
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">basic memory proof</a>
to that address.  Further, any time a value is written into this
special address, I assert that it wasn’t full before.  When this special value
is read out of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>,
I also assert that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> is outputting the
right value.  In between, I assert that the memory contains my value of
interest.  It’s the <a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">same three basic properties we’ve already
discussed</a>, and it worked
quite well in this context.</p>

<h4 id="last-stage">Last-Stage</h4>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 7. The butterfly to the last stage</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/fft-laststage.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/laststage.v">last
stage</a>
of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> is special.
It implements the same radix-2 butterfly
as any other stage, save that 1) it operates on adjacent pairs of data and
2) the complex exponential evaluates to either plus or minus one.  That
means all the work can be done using adds and subtracts–no multiplies are
required.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-dft-laststage.png" alt="" width="196" /></td></tr></table>

<p>When I struggled to get this simple operation right, I groaned at having to
build another test bench.  I just wanted this thing to work and building and
maintaining all those test benches were getting painful.  Couldn’t I just
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">prove</a> that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/laststage.v">my
code</a>
would work first using <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a>?</p>

<p>So I created a formal properties section in the laststage.v, and recorded
a copy of the data that came into the core within that section.</p>

	<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I could then verify that the data going out matched the known
butterfly
equations.  First, there was the output that was the sum of the two inputs.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then there was the output that was their difference.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There are a couple important things to note here.  First, I didn’t use
<code class="highlighter-rouge">$past()</code> to capture the incoming data.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">$past()</code> works great for expressing
values for one (or more) clocks ago.  The problem with this implementation
was the <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> value.  Were this value always <code class="highlighter-rouge">1'b1</code>, or even always alternating
<code class="highlighter-rouge">1'b1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">1'b0</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">$past()</code> might have been useful.  However, I needed to make
certain that the formal proof properly checked whether <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> was used
properly.  That meant I had to allow the formal solver to pick when <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code>
was high and when it wasn’t.  Hence, the output value, <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_val = {o_r,o_i}</code>
might depend upon <code class="highlighter-rouge">$past(i_val,2)</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">$past(i_val,3)</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">$past(i_val,4)</code>,
or … you get the idea.</p>

<p>A little more logic was required to make certain I knew which of the two
values to output at any given time, <code class="highlighter-rouge">y0</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">y1</code>, but no more logic than
that was required.</p>

<p>At this point, I started to get excited by the idea of
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verifying</a>
parts and pieces of <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this FFT</a>.
Assertions like this weren’t that hard, and they could be easily made.</p>

<p>So I moved on to the next module, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">qtrstgae.v</code>.</p>

<h4 id="the-penultimate-fft-stage">The Penultimate FFT Stage</h4>

<p>I call the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/qtrstage.v">second to the last FFT stage the quarter
stage</a>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">qtrstage</code>.  This is the stage that applies two radix-2 butterflies to pairs
within every set of four points.  There were points 0 and 2, and points 1 and 3.</p>

<p>Like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">laststage</code>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/qtrstage.v">this stage</a>
also required only additions and subtractions
to implement the necessary multiplies required by the butterfly.  Unlike the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">laststage</code>, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle factors</a>
in this penultimate stage required multiplication by <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">j</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">-1</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">-j</code>.
This can still be implemented with additions and subtractions–I just needed
to keep track of which values these additions and subtractions were applied to.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-dft-qtrstage.png" alt="" width="258" /></td></tr></table>

<p>If you expand the last equation into its complex components, you’ll see
that it truly can be represented by just additions and subtractions.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-dft-qtrstage-mpy.png" alt="" width="251" /></td></tr></table>

<p>For this stage, I tried the same basic proof approach as the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/laststage.v">prior
stage</a>.
I created the sum and difference values, and verified that these indeed
matched as they were supposed to.  This logic was no more difficult than
before.  Aside from breaking the output into its real and imaginary
portions,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="kt">wire</span>	<span class="kt">signed</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">OWIDTH</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>	<span class="n">f_o_real</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">f_o_imag</span><span class="o">;</span>

<p>I could then verify each of the various output real and imaginary values,
depending upon which state, <code class="highlighter-rouge">f_state</code>, the core was in.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These were the three easy proofs, <code class="highlighter-rouge">bitreverse</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">laststage</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">qtrstage</code>.
How was I going to then prove the butterflies?  Those depended upon a
multiply, and formal tools tend to <em>really</em> struggle with multiplies.</p>

<h4 id="the-hardware-assisted-butterfly">The Hardware Assisted Butterfly</h4>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 8. A Decimation in Frequency Butterfly</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/fft-butterfly.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">This FFT core generator</a>
uses two separate types of butterfly implementations.
The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/hwbfly.v">first</a>
uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a> elements
within those
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>s
that have them.  The core simply makes the assumption that <code class="highlighter-rouge">A * B</code> can
be implemented by the synthesizer in hardware.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">second butterfly
implementation</a>
uses a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">logic
multiply</a>
implementation built specifically for this core.
Each of the two butterfly implementations has its own Verilog file, so we’ll
discuss them separately.  In this section, we’ll discuss the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/hwbfly.v">hardware assisted
butterfly</a>
that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a>
elements.</p>

<p>When I started this major update, I had a working <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/hwbfly.v">hardware assisted butterfly
implementation</a>.
In that original implementation, everything moved forward anytime <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> was
true, and it required three hardware assisted multiplication elements
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a> blocks)
to complete.</p>

<p>However, if you are using an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> with only
90 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a>s that need to
be shared between other operations (i.e. <a href="/dsp/2017/09/15/fastfir.html">high speed
filters</a>), those
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a>s
can become very precious.  How precious?  When I built my first asynchronous
sample rate converter, I quickly ran out of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a>
elements before finishing.
Were I to use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
in addition to such a poor design (it’s since been fixed), I might not have
enough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a>s to make
it work.</p>

<p>So I looked again at this algorithm to see if I could spare some multiplies.
What if the signal didn’t arrive at the rate of one sample every clock?
What if I could instead insist that the incoming data was less than half that 
speed, so there would always be an idle cycle between any two clock periods
where <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> was true?  If that were the case, I could then share one
multiplication element between two of the three multiplies I needed to compute.</p>

<p>Alternatively, what if the signal didn’t arrive at a rate of every other clock,
but would arrive no faster than every third clock?  I might then share the
hardware multiply between the three separate multiplies I needed to calculate.</p>

<p>You can see the possibilities in Fig 9 on the right.</p>
<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 9. Multiplies per FFT stage</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/fft-dsp-cost.png" alt="541" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This required modifying my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/hwbfly.v">hardware butterfly
implementation</a>.</p>

<p>I managed to do this without too much fanfare, and without much work I modified
my bench test and could get the hardware
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a> to pass.  I did
the same for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">regular (non-hardware assisted)
butterfly</a>
as well.  The problem was that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
kept failing in practice.  It passed the component bench testing step,
but yet still failed.</p>

<p>In frustration, I switched verification methods to
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal</a>.</p>

<p>I hadn’t wanted to do this at first.  I am painfully aware that
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
really struggle to handle multiplies, and these butterfly implementations both
depended heavily upon the multiply.  How could I test an algorithm that
required multiplies, without running into this trouble?</p>

<p>The solution for me came from the
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
concept of abstraction, something I have yet to discuss on this blog.
(It’s a part of my
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
<a href="/projects.html">class</a>,
and on my to do list for the blog.)</p>

<p>We’ll start with the basics.  Here was the code I wanted to verify.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

		<span class="k">begin</span>
			<span class="c1">// Third clock, pipeline = 3
</span>			<span class="c1">//   As desired, each of these lines infers a DSP48
</span>			<span class="n">rp_one</span>   <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">p1c_in</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">p1d_in</span><span class="o">;</span>
			<span class="n">rp_two</span>   <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">p2c_in</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">p2d_in</span><span class="o">;</span>
			<span class="n">rp_three</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">p3c_in</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">p3d_in</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>From processing the previous two modules, I knew how to set up a verification
test of the result: I’d copy the inputs into a memory delay line on every
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code>, and then verify the result at the end given the incoming values.</p>

<p>I also knew that the hard multiply implementation “worked”.  This was the one
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a>s.
Hence I didn’t need to verify that the multiply worked.  Any tool that
allowed me to do this was one where the multiply was supported and worked.
I was willing to trust my tools.</p>

<p>I wasn’t willing to trust <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">my own multiplication
implementation</a>–but
we’ll come back to that in a moment.</p>

<p>So I replaced the hardware multiplies with something that was nearly equivalent,
an abstraction.  In <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/formal/abs_mpy.v">this
abstraction</a>,
the results were allowed to be any value,
chosen by the tools, but meeting three criteria: 1) zero times anything is
zero, 2) one times anything preserves the initial value, 3) negative one
times anything negates the other operand, and 4) the same concept, but
applied to higher powers of two instead of just one.  <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/formal/abs_mpy.v">This
abstraction</a>
isn’t really a multiply, it just maintains some of the properties of
multiplication.</p>

<p>You can examine it here in the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/formal/abs_mpy.v"><code class="highlighter-rouge">abs_mpy.v</code>
file</a>
if you would like.</p>

<p>So, I replaced my multiplies with this abstraction.  Here it is for the
highest speed case where a data value could come in at any time.</p>

<p>Then later, within the formal property section of the code, I allowed the
formal tool to pick what data would come into the core and what coefficient
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle factor</a>)

with one and zero.</p>

<p>The only problem was, at this point in my development, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> still didn’t
work.</p>

<p>So I kept working.</p>

<h4 id="the-soft-butterfly">The Soft Butterfly</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> has a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/hwbfly.v">second
butterfly implementation</a>,
one that uses no hardware
accelerated multiplies.  Instead, it uses a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">(rather poor) multiplication
implementation</a>
in logic.  I say <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">this
implementation</a>
is rather poor simply because I haven’t yet optimized it, and because I know
that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/fwmpy">better implementations</a> exist.
In my case, I wanted a single multiplication implementation that could be
parameterized and yet apply to all bit-widths.  Worse, that implementation
needs to know what its own processing delay is.  My bare-bones,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">basic implementation</a>
does all of the above, it just could be better.  <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/fwmpy">My own optimmized
multiplication implementations</a> doesn’t meet
this criteria.</p>

<p>In the story of this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
development, it was this part of the implementation
that was most problematic for me.  I didn’t dare replace the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">hand-built
multiply</a>
within it with some abstraction, primarily because I didn’t trust it: I was
always concerned there was a latent bug within the multiply.  For
example, what if I didn’t get the delay right?</p>

<p>This was also the stage that was responsible for several bugs that were a pain
to chase down.</p>

<p>I ran <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/tree/master/bench/cpp">bench tests</a>
on this stage in all three modes: continuous <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code>s,
one clock between <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code>s, and two clocks between <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code>s.  When the design
failed, I adjusted each of these three elements to randomly include another
clock step with <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> false.  The tests would pass, and the design would fail.</p>

<p>The bug, as it turns out, was quite subtle.</p>

<p>Because the delay within my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">hand-made
soft-multiply</a>
was dependent upon the bit width, and because this was captured by
a parameter, and because the way I set up my
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
tests only one parameter set was getting tested despite multiple parameters
(and hence multiply delays) being used by the full
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>, the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/butterfly_tb.cpp">bench test</a>
might pass for one set of multiplication bit-widths
and fail for the set that wasn’t bench tested.</p>

<p>I didn’t find this bug until I started using
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>,
although technically my
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
approach suffers from the same problem of only testing some multiplication
bit-widths.</p>

<p>For this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">soft
butterfly</a>,
I call it <code class="highlighter-rouge">butterfly.v</code>, I created the same basic
properties I had been using for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/hwbfly.v">hardware assisted
butterfly</a>.</p>

<p>To my immense relief, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">this
butterfly</a>
 failed to pass
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
(initially).  Indeed, it failed very quickly.  Why was this to my relief?
Because I had been struggling to find the bug.  It turns out, the bug was
associated with the remainder of the multiplication delay divided by two
or three–depending upon the mode.  A subtly different timing implementation
was required for each remainder, and I found that by using
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, I could’ve found this using my test bench as well.  I just had two problems
when using it: First, I didn’t trust that it would try the right input
combination to trigger the bug.  Second, I was getting really tired of working
through GB <a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">traces</a>.</p>

<p>Now that I know what the problem was, the proof requires proving the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> for multiple
different potential parameter sets.
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a> handles this nicely
using tasks–something I haven’t discussed much on the blog.  You can see the
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/formal/butterfly.sby">script I used here</a>,
which includes the multiple task definitions if you are interested.</p>

<p>My problem with this proof is that while it quickly found my bugs in minutes,
it struggled to prove that there are no bugs.  By “struggled” I mean the took
multiple days–so long that I never let it finish.</p>

<p>So I dug back into the proof.  I set up criteria within every stage of the
multiply to guide the proof: if multiplying by zero, the result in the middle
should be zero, if by one, etc.  I could then verify that the multiply
would truly return zero on a zero input, or return the same value on a one
input.</p>

<p>This still took forever.</p>

<p>The difficulty of this proof is also why this article took so long to write.
I had the essential proofs working early on, but this one proof just seemed
to take forever.</p>

<p>Part of the issue here is, how long are you willing to wait for a proof to
return?  I personally want my proofs to all return within about fifteen minutes.
I’ll tolerate two to three hours, but not without grumping about it.  However,
this proof was taking over 72 hrs+ before I’d kill it.  This is unacceptable.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 10. Butterfly RTL components</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/fft-butterfly-hierarchy.svg" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>To understand the problem, consider Fig. 10.  I had verified the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">long binary
multiply implementation, <code class="highlighter-rouge">longbimpy</code></a>.
I just wanted to prove some simple properties about the result, based upon the
initial values given to the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/butterfly.v">butterfly</a>.
I wanted to verify that my estimate of the number of clocks
required by the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">long binary
multiply</a>
 matched the length of my FIFO.  I wanted
to verify that the coefficients and inputs still matched the outputs, and that
one coefficient wasn’t getting confused with another piece of data.</p>

<p>To do this, I insisted that a zero coefficient must result in a zero result.
A one coefficient must duplicate the data, and vice versa for the data.  These
are bare simple multiplication properties, but though they are simplistic
they are sufficient for verifying if the right inputs are given to the
multiplies, and if the matching results are drawn from them.</p>

<p>After about two weeks of running 48+ hrs proofs that I’d never allow to
complete, I finally figured out how to bring the solution time down to
something more reasonable.  The trick?  Asserting that the inputs to the
multiply matched the butterflies copy of what those inputs were.  This last
assertion connected the proofs taking place within the multiply, with the
proofs that were about to take place on the multiply’s outputs.</p>

<p>This necessitated a change to the portlist of the multiply, a change that
only needs to be made for the formal proof and not otherwise.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">module</span>	<span class="n">longbimpy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">i_a_unsorted</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">i_b_unsorted</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">o_r</span>

<span class="cp">`endif</span>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">unsorted</code> post-fix above references the number of bits in the values <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_a</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_b</code>.  The algorithm internally sorts these two values so that the values
with the most bits is in <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_b</code>.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">*_unsorted</code> values just describe the
values before the bitwidth sort.</p>

<p>Then, internal to the butterfly itself, I assert that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">f_past_a_unsorted</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">f_past_b_unsorted</code> values match the ones within the module.  There’s a
bit of unwinding that needs to take effect, though, since the those values can
refer to any of the multiplies inputs depending upon the time step.  That
places these values into <code class="highlighter-rouge">fp_*_ic</code> for the coefficient and <code class="highlighter-rouge">fp_*_id</code> for
the data.</p>

<p>The last step is to verify these two values match, for all three of the
multiplication input sets.</p>

<p>That assertion was sufficient to bring the proof time down from days to hours.</p>

<p>I can handle hours.  I can’t handle days.</p>

<h4 id="full-fft-stages">Full FFT Stages</h4>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 11. A Decimation in Frequency Butterfly</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/fft-fftstage.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Because the butterflies were so hard to prove, I hadn’t spend much time
trying to formally verify the separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> stages.  I had just tested and
verified that these worked using the traditional bench testing method–using
carefully chosen and random inputs.</p>

<p>Then, later, I got to thinking: this FFT implementation is <em>so</em> close to having
a full formal verification proof, why not just add this last piece to the
set?  So I dug into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> stage component.</p>

<p>In the language of this core generator, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> stage is that portion of the
core that accepts inputs and feeds a single radix-2 butterfly.  This
means, for an <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code>-point FFT stage, the core needs to read <code class="highlighter-rouge">N/2</code> values into
memory, and then apply these values, the next <code class="highlighter-rouge">N/2</code> input values, and a stored
ROM coefficient to the butterfly core.  This butterfly core will return a pair
of values some number of clocks later.  The data then need to be separated
again.  One output value from the butterfly needs to go immediately to the
output, the other value must go into memory.  Once <code class="highlighter-rouge">N/2</code> values are output,
the butterfly becomes idle and the stored <code class="highlighter-rouge">N/2</code> values can be returned.</p>

<p>Could this piece be <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally
verified</a>?</p>

<p>Yes, it can.  To do this, though, I replaced the butterfly implementation
with a similar abstract implementation–like I had with the hardware multiply
when verifying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block#Hard_blocks">DSP</a>-enabled butterflies.
This abstract butterfly implementation returned arbitrary values selected by
the formal engine.  It also had a multiplication delay within it that would
be chosen by the formal engine, so that one proof could be made independent
of the final butterfly implementation and multiplier delay.</p>

<p>Once done, the basic proof simply followed the <a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">three basic memory
properties</a>.
That is, I allowed the formal engine to pick an arbitrary address to the input
to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/fftstage.v">FFT
stage</a>,
and then created a property to describe the inputs to the butterfly
on the clock of this address.</p>

<p>Any time the first value
to the butterfly showed up and got placed into memory, I’d capture that
value and assert that it remained in memory.</p>

<p>Did you notice how I checked that the coefficient, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ib_c</code>, matched the ROM

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle factor</a>.</p>

<p>I then used roughly the <a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">same set of properties
properties</a>
on the other side of the butterfly.</p>

<p>While I’d like to say that formally verifying this
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/fftstage.v">FFT stage</a>
helped me find some latent bug, that wasn’t the case this time.  Once
I debugged the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
properties, this part of the core “just worked.”</p>

<p>The only thing was, I noticed that the block RAM read on the output path
wasn’t optimized for all block RAM implementations.  (Some internal RAM
reads require the result be registered.)  Because of the
formal properties, when I changed this implementation to something
more portable and better, I could make this change with confidence.</p>

<h4 id="how-much-was-verified">How much was verified?</h4>

<p>I like to say that I have formally verified the entire FFT.  You might even
hear me boasting of this.  This isn’t quite true.  I only verified <em>most</em>
of the FFT.  (Queue the Princess Bride “mostly
dead quote here …)  I didn’t formally verify that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twiddle_factor">twiddle factors</a>
were right, that the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">soft multiply
worked</a>,
or that the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/fftmain.v">top
level</a> was
properly wired together.</p>

<p>To see how much was
formally verified, consider Fig 12 on the left.  Everything
but the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">long binary multiply,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">longbimpy</code></a>,

<code class="highlighter-rouge">fftmain</code></a>,
has been <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally

<p>I also only verified the components for particular parameter settings, not
necessarily the settings used within the generated design.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/rtl/longbimpy.v">soft binary multiply,
longbimpy</a>,
was <em>functionally</em> verified (i.e. verified by <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/bench/cpp/mpy_tb.v">test

in an exhaustive sense.  By that I mean that for a particular number of
coefficient bits, I tested every single multiply input looking for
problems.  While this may be overkill,
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>?
Please consider
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this core generator</a>
for that purpose.  Using
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this core generator</a>,
you can create roughly any
<a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">pipelined</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> implementation.
Even better, because the core is completely open source, you can use this
implementation within a
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
simulation in a way you’d never be able to do with a proprietary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> core generator.</p>

<p>The second point I’d like to draw from this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> discussion is that,
yes,
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>
is up to an industrial formal verification task.  It can be applied to very
complex designs (no pun intended), piece by piece, just like we did with <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this
FFT core generator</a>.</p>

<p>You may also note that we didn’t formally verify
the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
at once.  Neither did we formally verify that known input test vectors would
produce known output vectors.  If we did our job right, this will be a
consequence.  Somehow I just still didn’t trust the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
until running known data signals through it.  Hence, I still used
simulation to ultimately verify that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
as a whole was working.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’ve checked out my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/fftdemo">FFT-Demo</a>
at all, you’ll see that an entire design using both co-simulated A/D,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/fftdemo/blob/master/rtl/subfildown.v">downsampling
filter</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>, and
VGA output can all be simulated together.  In that case, all of the
components have been verified, but the full simulation of the entire
design is still very valuable.</p>
