    <p>A common <a href="http://www.fpga4fun.com/PWM_DAC.html">beginners FPGA</a> task is to
build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">Pulse Width
Modulated (PWM)</a>
signal.  Such signals, when fed into an <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-amp2-audio-amplifier/">appropriately modified
amplifier</a>, can
be used to create an audio signal that can then be heard.</p>

<p>Indeed, you might think of this as a poor man’s digital to analog converter,
since the circuitry required to turn a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a> signal into
an audio signal is quite minimal.  Likewise,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-amp2-audio-amplifier/">audio hardware</a>
($10 USD) can be cheaper than the corresponding
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2S">I2S</a>
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-i2s-stereo-audio-output/">based Digital to Analog Converter</a> ($15 USD).</p>

<p>Today, let’s add some additional functionality and performance to this
<a href="http://www.fpga4fun.com/PWM_DAC.html">traditional beginner’s project</a>.
Even better, let’s make this a simple <em>no cost</em> improvement to the
traditional audio output–one that solves several common problems commonly
associated with the traditional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
development.
Our result will have the quality of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation">PDM</a>
signal, but without the painful cost of generating one.</p>

<h2 id="the-traditional-development">The traditional development</h2>

<p>Let’s start by outlining the basics of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal is simply a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal">digital signal</a>
that gets used in an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal">analog</a>
context.  You can think of the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-amp2-audio-amplifier">PModAMP2</a>
as a good hardware example for this discussion, although the discussion
is much more general than just the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-amp2-audio-amplifier">PModAMP2</a>.</p>

<p>The definition of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal revolves around an time interval, <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code>.  During that
interval, the output signal starts as a logic one.  After some period of
time, determined by the desired but approximate output voltage, the signal
transitions to zero.
A minimum output voltage is created by transitioning immediately to zero.
A maximum output voltage is created by waiting to the end of the interval
before transitioning to a logic zero.</p>

<p>Pictorially, this might look like Fig 1.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1: A PWM waveform sample</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/pwm-example-defn.png" alt="Setting up a CORDIC" width="868" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In this figure, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal is shown in red.  The current time this waveform is positive is given
by <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code>.  The information within the waveform is captured by moving the
transition time back and forth with respect to the center of the period.</p>

<p>With a signal description that simple, generating a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM modulator</a>
is as simple as any good beginner’s assignment should be.</p>

<p>First, you will need a counter.  This will count from the beginning to the end
of the interval, and then start over.  If we use the <a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">handshake pipeline
signaling</a>
strategy, then we’ll need an <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_busy</code> (a.k.a. stall) signal to slow down any
logic that is feeding our pipeline.  Hence, if we allow for a constant length
interval of <code class="highlighter-rouge">COUNTS_PER_INTERVAL</code> clock ticks, the first part of our code
will look like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">always @(posedge i_clk)
	if (counter &gt;= COUNTS_PER_INTERVAL-1)
	begin
		counter &lt;= 0;
		sample &lt;= i_sample;
	end else
		counter &lt;= counter + 1'b1;

always @(posedge i_clk)
	o_busy &lt;= (counter == COUNTS_PER_INTERVAL-2);</code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that we need to compare the counter against <code class="highlighter-rouge">COUNTS_PER_INTERVAL-1</code>
to make certain that we have an interval <code class="highlighter-rouge">COUNTS_PER_INTERVAL</code> long.  Likewise,
we want the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_busy</code> signal to be true for the one clock when
<code class="highlighter-rouge">counts == COUNTS_PER_INTERVAL-1</code>, and to do that we need to set it one
clock earlier.</p>

<p>The last step, that of determining whether or not our pin should be on or off,
is determined by the simplest comparison:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">always @(posedge i_clk)
	o_pin &lt;= (counter &lt; sample);</code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s how you build an audio
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
peripheral.</p>

<p>The problem wih this approach is that audio sounds horrible.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-the-traditional-development">Problems with the traditional development</h2>

<p>Let’s spend a moment and discuss all of the problems associated with generating
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal in this fashion.  This will help guide our solution later.</p>

<p>The first problem with this algorithm is that the samples need to range
between one and <code class="highlighter-rouge">COUNTS_PER_INTERVAL-1</code>.  Commonly, samples are represented as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twos_complement">two’s complement</a>
integers ranging from between <code class="highlighter-rouge">-2^(N-1)</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^(N-1)-1</code>.
Converting from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twos_complement">two’s complement</a>
to the samples this algorithm would require is going to require
multiplying by <code class="highlighter-rouge">(COUNTS_PER_INTERVAL-2)/2^N</code> and then flipping the sign bit.
While the divide by <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^N</code> can be accomplished just dropping the lower
<code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> bits, this still requires a multiply by
<code class="highlighter-rouge">COUNTS_PER_INTERVAL-2</code>.
It would be nice to have an alternative that doesn’t require any multiplies.</p>

<p>The second problem with the standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
development is that the only way to send a zero is to send a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave">square wave</a>
with a 50% duty cycle (tau is in the center of the interval).  Such a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave">square wave</a>
is a tone which can be heard when the audio is supposed to be silent, should
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">COUNTS_PER_INTERVAL</code> be large enough.  Indeed, this “silent” tone can be
very obnoxious on the ears.</p>

<p>The third problem with the development above is that the sample rate
<em>must</em> be an integer divisor of the system sample rate.  This limits the
sample rates that can be created.</p>

<p>Coupled with the sample rate is the difficulty of getting a high
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range">dynamic range</a>.
More output voltage resolution requires a slower sample rate.
However, a slower sample rate brings the nasty audio
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic">harmonics</a>
into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range">audio range</a>.
For this reason, it can appear impossible to get good sound quality
from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
output.  Perhaps this was the idea, but we’ll do better in a moment.</p>

<p>The final problem with this means of creating an audio signal is that
it creates lots of unwanted
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic">harmonics</a>,
i.e. distortions, in the audio that you
wish to produce.  We’ll see these when we introduce our improvements in a
moment.  Our goal should be to reduce these distortions.</p>

<p>Hang on, that’s coming up.</p>

<h2 id="how-a-pwm-fits-into-a-digital-audio-system">How a PWM fits into a digital audio system</h2>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 2: Audio Hearing Range</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/pwm-hearing-range.svg" alt="A PWM sinewave" width="380" /></td></tr></table>
<p>Before we can make an improvement, you need to understand that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range">ear can
<em>only</em> hear sounds between about 20Hz and
20kHz</a>.  To be successful, the
period of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal will then need to be well above 20kHz—out of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range">range of hearing</a>.</p>

<p>Hence, a good
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-amp2-audio-amplifier">audio circuit</a>
(audiophiles please forgive me for calling this “good”), following
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
output, will place a filter on the output to remove anything above 20kHz.</p>

<p>This means that if we can push any distortions towards higher frequency
components, then these distortions will get filtered out by the amplifier
circuitry (or your ear), and the result will sound more pleasing to the ear.</p>

<p>Can this be done?</p>

<h2 id="a-better-pwm">A better PWM</h2>

<p>Ok, you’ve waited enough, here’s the technique: <em>Bit-reverse the counter</em> before
comparing it with the sample.
Further, we’ll insist that our
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
counter have a power of two length so that
the bit reversed counter will take on the same values that the counter would’ve
taken on in the first place.  The result is a waveform that is like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>,
although technically not a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a> signal.
It is more generally a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation">PDM</a> signal,
but unlike the implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation">PDM</a>
presented on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation">Wikipedia</a>
this implementation is very easy to calculate.  Like both
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation">PDM</a>
the result will nominally maintain the same number of output clock periods
that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
output would have been on.  Likewise, it will also be off for the same number
of clock periods that a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
output would have been off.  (Assuming <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^N</code> clocks per interva.)  It will
produce the same number of one’s, and
the same number of zero’s.  The only difference is that bit-reversing the
counter will cause these one’s and zero’s to be produced in a different order.</p>

<p>I’m going to call this new signal type simply <em>bit-reversed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a></em>,
even though technically it’s not really a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a> signal at all
any more.</p>

<p>To understand what’s going on, let’s consider what the traditional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
output would be for a sine-wave (shown in Fig 3 below).</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3: A PWM sinewave</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/pwm-sinewave.png" alt="A PWM sinewave" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at that same sine wave output, but this time we’ll
bit reverse the counter before creating our output signal.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4: An improved PWM sinewave</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/pwm-sine-improved.png" alt="An improved PWM sinewave" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>From this figure, you can see that there are <em>many</em> more transitions in the
bit-reversed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal.  Another way of saying this is that the
bit-reversed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal has a lot more high frequency content.  This extra high frequency
content should be easier to filter out with cheap analog circuitry, and hence
the remaining audio quality should be better.</p>

<p>Enough of the hand-waving, is this new approach actually better?  To answer
that question, let’s look at a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a>
of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
encoded sine wave in Fig 3, and let’s compare it to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a>
of the bit-reversed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a> sinewave from
Fig 4.  We’ll place this frequency comparison into Fig 5 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 5: Comparing PWM frequency responses</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/pwm-harmonics.png" alt="Comparing PWM frequency responses" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In this Figure, the vertical bars are frequency components, running from just
above zero frequency at the left to higher frequencies at the right.  Their
height is given by the magnitude squared of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a>
output values.  These are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel">decibel</a>
 values.
The tone we want to create is represented by the tall
vertical bar near the y-axis line.  The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a>
of the original
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
scheme is represented in red, whereas the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a>
of our modified bit-reversed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
sinewave is represented in green.</p>

<p>Now that you understand the graph, notice the additional red bars to the
right of the bar associated with our audio signal (the sinewave).  These are
distortions.  Your
ear will hear these distortions, and the result won’t sound like the pleasant
tone you wanted.</p>

<p>If you look further, you won’t see any green distortions to
speak of.  It’s not that they aren’t there, it’s just that they’ve been spread
out and spread across a much higher frequency range.  Those distortions in
green that do remain within the audio range are much smaller in magnitude.</p>

<p>The next step, now that we know how to improve this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
development, is to build our improved signal and hear what it sounds like.</p>

<h2 id="building-the-updated-pwms-logic">Building the updated PWM’s logic</h2>

<p>Let’s now work through how to code this bit-reversed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal, and make an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpwmaudio">audio controller</a>
using the scheme.</p>

<p>The first step to creating a more pleasing sounding
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
audio waveform is to bit–reverse the counter.  If we let our counter be a
simple 16-bit number, we can reverse it with a for loop within a Verilog
generate statement.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">// The bit-reversed (br) counter
wire	[15:0]	br_counter;
genvar	k;
generate for(k=0; k&lt;16; k=k+1)
begin : bit_reversal_loop
	assign br_counter[k] = pwm_counter[15-k];
end endgenerate</code></pre></figure>

<p>The beginning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>.
student should remember that for loops in Verilog <em>are not
like for loops in software</em>.  This loop does nothing but rename the wires
within the original <code class="highlighter-rouge">pwm_counter</code>.  It requires no
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>
instructions, nor
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_block">logic elements</a>,
to be accomplished.  As a result,
there’s no time consumed by the logic this loop creates.</p>

<p>This loop is actually the whole key to the algorithm, and the source of the
difference we are going to create.  If you’ve built
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a> based audio signal
before, you now understand how to build a better one.  We’ll keep going,
though, just for completeness.</p>

<p>We can then create our output from comparing this bit-reversed counter to the
sample we would desire to output.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">// Create the PWM output
always @(posedge i_clk)
	o_pin &lt;= (sample_out &lt;= br_counter);</code></pre></figure>

<p>You can find the code to create this type of waveform in my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpwmaudio/blob/master/rtl/wbpwmaudio.v">wbpwmaudio
repository</a>
on <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU">GitHub</a>.  However, if you look over <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpwmaudio/blob/master/rtl/wbpwmaudio.v">the
code</a>
alone, you might find there’s a bit more to it than the code written above.</p>

<p>The first thing missing is the timer to tell the
bit reversed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
audio driver when to switch samples.  Unlike our original development,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpwmaudio/blob/master/rtl/wbpwmaudio.v">wbpwmaudio
core</a>
uses a user-configurable count-down timer.  This configurable value is placed
into <code class="highlighter-rouge">w_reload_value</code>, allowing us to write our count-down timer as,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">initial	timer = DEFAULT_RELOAD;
initial	ztimer= 1'b0;

// ztimer is true for one clock pulse any time the timer restarts.
always @(posedge i_clk)
	ztimer &lt;= (timer == { {(TIMING_BITS-1){1'b0}}, 1'b1 });
always @(posedge i_clk)
	if (ztimer)
		timer &lt;= w_reload_value;
	else
		timer &lt;= timer - ,1'b1};</code></pre></figure>

<p>You might find this code very similar to the count-down timer logic found
in our <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/generating-timing.html">timing
post</a>.
The big thing you may find different is the parameterized number of bits in
the counter.  In this case, the number of bits in the timer counter is
defined by the parameter,<code class="highlighter-rouge">TIMING_BITS</code>.  Why?  Because I needed to be able
to trim the logic within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</a> project down until the project
<a href="/blog/2017/06/12/minimizing-luts.html">could fit</a>
onto
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>’s <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod
S6</a>.</p>

<p>The other thing you may notice is that the timer reload value isn’t connected
to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
counter any more.  Heresy!  No, actually it makes a lot of sense.  Because the
output bit order is spread uniformly across the sample interval, chopping a
value off before it’s had enough time to send all of its bits isn’t something
the ear will notice.  Further, this allows us to use arbitrary audio
intervals, without suffering significant loss.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this simple change renders genering samples easier.  Not only
can we feed this value
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twos_complement">two’s complement</a>
values now, but we can do so at our
favorite rate.  What if there aren’t enough clocks to transmit all the bits
in this new value?  Not a problem, the algorithm will adjust so that it
transmits as many bits as you have time to transmit.</p>

<p>In other words, that’s all it takes to generate this bit-reversed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal.</p>

<p>Let’s go one step further, though.  Let’s connect this controller to a
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">Wishbone bus</a>, so
that we can send values to our core across such an interface.</p>

<h2 id="adding-wishbone-control">Adding Wishbone Control</h2>

<p>Let’s now turn this into a fairly complete
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
audio controller.  To do this, we’ll add a user configurable sample rate,
some registers to control the power control wires in the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-amp2-audio-amplifier">PModAMP2</a>,
and a means of sending audio samples to the controller.  Finally, we’ll add an
interrupt line to let the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">bus master</a>
know that another sample is needed.</p>

<p>A more capable controller would include a
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>
so as to minimize the cost of servicing this controller, but I’ll leave that
as an exercise for the student.  For now, we’ll follow the development used
for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</a>,
where the whole goal was to <a href="/blog/2017/06/12/minimizing-luts.html">minimize the amount of the
logic</a>, and leave the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a> out.</p>

<p>If you’ve never built a
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">wishbone</a>
slave before, you might wish to read our
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/29/simple-wishbone.html">previous discussion</a>
as a background reference first.</p>

<p>Our first task is going to be creating a reconfigurable sample rate.  In a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
system, the sample rate is determined by the number of clocks per sample
duration.  We’ll call this number of samples <code class="highlighter-rouge">w_reload_value</code>–something you’ve
already seen above.  The
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpwmaudio/blob/master/rtl/wbpwmaudio.v">wbpwmaudio</a>
code offers two methods of setting this value.  These two methods are selectable
at design time via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">VARIABLE_RATE</code> parameter.  If <code class="highlighter-rouge">VARIABLE_RATE</code> is zero
(false), then the timer will always reload its value from a fixed
parameter value, <code class="highlighter-rouge">DEFAULT_RELOAD</code>, at the end of every interval.  If
<code class="highlighter-rouge">VARIABLE_RATE</code> is true, on the other hand, then the timer will reload its
value from a programmable register.</p>

<p>Since we are using <a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">wishbone</a> control,
this register will need to be set from the bus any time <code class="highlighter-rouge">(i_wb_stb)</code> is high,
indicating a bus cycle, <code class="highlighter-rouge">(i_wb_we)</code> is high, indicating a bus write cycle, and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">(i_wb_addr)</code> is high, indicating we are writing to the second of two
registers–the timer reload register.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">generate if (VARIABLE_RATE != 0)
begin
	reg	[(TIMING_BITS-1):0]	r_reload_value;
	initial	r_reload_value = DEFAULT_RELOAD;
	always @(posedge i_clk) // Data write
		if ((i_wb_stb)&amp;&amp;(i_wb_addr)&amp;&amp;(i_wb_we))
			r_reload_value &lt;= i_wb_data[(TIMING_BITS-1):0];
	assign	w_reload_value = r_reload_value;
end else begin
	assign	w_reload_value = DEFAULT_RELOAD;
end endgenerate</code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ve already seen above how this affects our timer: when the timer runs out,
it gets reset with this value.  Likewise, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ztimer</code> is set to be true any
time the timer has run out.</p>

<p>This is also going to control when the design accepts the next sample:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">always @(posedge i_clk)
	if (ztimer)
		sample_out &lt;= next_sample;</code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">next_sample</code> is a one-sample buffer.  It allows the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>
or any other
<a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-wb-master.html">bus master</a>ing
audio controller
a full sample interval in order to reload the value.</p>

<p>Setting this one-sample buffer will be our next step.  In this case, we’ll
set it any time a bus write takes place <code class="highlighter-rouge">(i_wb_stb)&amp;&amp;(i_wb_we)</code> to the
zero address of this port <code class="highlighter-rouge">(!i_wb_addr)</code>.
Alternatively, if we are using a fixed sample rate, we’ll ignore the address
and just set the sample.  In this case, we’ll set the sample based upon the
16-bit sample value on the input
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">wishbone bus</a>
data lines.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">initial	next_valid = 1'b1;
initial	next_sample = 16'h8000;
always @(posedge i_clk) // Data write
	if ((i_wb_stb)&amp;&amp;(i_wb_we)
			&amp;&amp;((!i_wb_addr)||(VARIABLE_RATE==0)))
	begin
		// Write with two's complement data, convert it
		// internally to binary offset
		next_sample &lt;= { !i_wb_data[15], i_wb_data[14:0] };
		next_valid &lt;= 1'b1;
		if (i_wb_data[16])
			o_aux &lt;= i_wb_data[(NAUX+20-1):20];
	end else if (ztimer)
		next_valid &lt;= 1'b0;</code></pre></figure>

<p>There’s a couple things to notice here.  First, notice the negation of bit
fifteen–a 16-bit sample’s most significant bit.  This is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twos_complement">two’s complement</a>
sign bit.  Flipping the sign bit is the way to convert
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twos_complement">two’s complement</a> values,
ranging from <code class="highlighter-rouge">-2^(N-1)</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^(N-1)-1</code> to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_binary">offset binary</a> values, ranging
from <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^N-1</code>, that a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
modulator needs.  Second, you’ll want to notice the <code class="highlighter-rouge">next_valid</code> logic.
This logic tells us whether or not the sample in our buffer is a valid
sample or not.  Upon any write, this value is set high to indicate we have a
valid sample in our buffer.  Whereas
any time the sample is moved from the one-sample buffer into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
modulation code as <code class="highlighter-rouge">sample_out</code>, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">next_valid</code> bit will be cleared to
indicate that there’s no valid sample in the buffer.</p>

<p>In this code, <code class="highlighter-rouge">next_sample</code> is set any time an audio sample is written to the
controller.  This is then fed to our output-sample value when the period
ends.  We’ll also note, upon setting this value, that the value is
valid (<code class="highlighter-rouge">next_valid</code>).  We’ll keep this valid signal true until our <code class="highlighter-rouge">next_sample</code>
value moves into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
output processing stage (above) as <code class="highlighter-rouge">sample_out</code>.</p>

<p>You may also notice the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_aux</code> value above.  I use the bits in <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_aux</code> to
control two bits which can then be used to control the gain and shutdown pins
from within this controller.  So that we can choose whether or not to send
samples or updated control pins, we require that bit sixteen be set if you
want to update the control pins, otherwise we leave the control pins alone.</p>

<p>At this point, we can move on and examine the values this controller
returns from the bus.  As in our <a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/29/simple-wishbone.html">first discussion of how to make a wishbone
peripheral</a>,
we’ll set the bus output lines no matter whether we are writing or reading.
It just simplifies the logic.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">generate if (VARIABLE_RATE == 0)
begin
	assign o_wb_data = { {(12-NAUX){1'b0}}, o_aux,
				3'h0, o_int, sample_out };
end else begin
	reg	[31:0]	r_wb_data;
	always @(posedge i_clk)
		if (i_wb_addr)
			r_wb_data &lt;= w_reload_value;
		else
			r_wb_data &lt;= { {(12-NAUX){1'b0}}, o_aux,
					3'h0, o_int, sample_out };
	assign	o_wb_data = r_wb_data;
end endgenerate</code></pre></figure>

<p>Selecting between which register to output took us one clock, so we’ll wait
one clock before acknowledge the clock in order to keep the acknowledgement
aligned with the data.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">initial	o_wb_ack = 1'b0;
always @(posedge i_clk)
	o_wb_ack &lt;= (i_wb_stb);</code></pre></figure>

<p>Further, the value(s) returned by this routine are always ready.  This routine
never has a reason to stall the bus.  (Repeated writes to the data register
will just over-write the buffer value.)  So, we’ll just keep the stall line low.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">assign	o_wb_stall = 1'b0;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, we’ll add in one further flair: an interrupt line to tell the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>
when the buffer is no longer valid and can be refilled.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">assign	o_int &lt;= (!next_valid);</code></pre></figure>

<p>While I suppose
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">wishbone</a>
support isn’t necessary for every core we present, this core already has it
and it was fun to present how a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
generator might be created as a bus slave.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That just about wraps up this post!</p>

<p>We’ve now gone over and discussed the traditional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
development, presenting how a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal can be used as a cheap
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter">digital to analog converter</a>.</p>

<p>We then presented a new approach to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
that we called the “bit-reversed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>”
approach.  We pointed out how this approach spreads the unwanted
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic">harmonic</a>
energy into higher frequencies, relieving some of the stress on
the anti-aliasing filter.  This approach also separated the timer
determining the edges of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a>
signal from the sample generator, with the purpose of removing some of the
noise associated with the periodic signal associated with no signal.</p>

<p>I have personally listened to the quality of the output of this amplifier.
My test signal has been a doorbell sound.  The doorbell comes out sounding
pure, with no noticable audio distortions.</p>

<p>No, I’m not suggesting this is “professional” audio quality, but it is better
than the alternative.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may encourage you to try <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpwmaudio">this component
IP</a>
yourself, to hear how it sounds?</p>

<p>Hmm … perhaps I should show you instead how this component may be
simply and easily be integrated into a basic debugging bus, so that you
can hear the sound quality for yourself?  That will have to remain, though,
as a lesson for another day.</p>
