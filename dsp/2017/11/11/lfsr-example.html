    <p>Some time ago,
<a href="/dsp/2017/10/27/lfsr.html">we examined</a> <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">Linear Feedback
Shift Registers
(LFSR)s</a>
and particularly how to create the logic necessary to implement two different
forms of an <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">LFSR</a>:
a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/lfsr_fib.v">Fibonacci</a>
and a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/lfsr_gal.v">Galois
form</a>.</p>

<p>Today, let’s go back to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/lfsr_fib.v">Fibonacci
form</a> of a
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">shift register</a>
and examine one particular set of coefficients, called <code class="highlighter-rouge">TAPS</code> in the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/lfsr_fib.v">code</a>,
to see what sort of sequence it produces.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1: An example 5-stage LFSR</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/lfsr-fib5.svg" alt="An example five stage LFSR" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In particular, let’s look at a 5-stage
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">LFSR</a>
with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TAPS</code> register given by <code class="highlighter-rouge">00101</code>.  You can see a picture of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/lfsr_fib.v">logic required to implement this</a>
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">shift register</a>
in Fig 1.  In this figure, you can see how the
output, together with the value of the register two stages earlier,
both get added (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">XOR</a>‘d) together
to produce the new MSB of the
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">shift register</a>.</p>

<p>Even better, I picked this particular set of coefficients in order to
guarantee that this <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">shift
register</a> has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_length_sequence">maximum length</a>.
For a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">register</a>
with five internal bits within it, bits that can never all be equal to zero,
this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_length_sequence">maximum length</a>
is <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^5-1</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">31</code>.  Hence, this
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">register</a>
has an output sequence of <code class="highlighter-rouge">31</code>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness">pseudorandom</a>
bits.</p>

<p>Finally, before we start working through the numbers, I’d like to note that
Fig 1 looks very similar to the figure <a href="/dsp/2017/10/27/lfsr.html">we presented
earlier</a>
when <a href="/dsp/2017/10/27/lfsr.html">we described how to build a generic shift
register</a>.
That figure is shown below in Fig 2.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2: The Generic Form of a Fibonacci LFSR Implementation</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/lfsr.svg" alt="Generic Fibonacci LFSR form" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The biggest difference you may notice between these two figures is that the
multiplies have been removed.  Those taps that were multiplied with zero
in this example have been removed.  Those taps that were multiplied by one
have been replaced by a simple wire.  That’s how multiplication is defined,
and how it actually takes place within
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field">GF(2)</a>.
Even better, all of this multiplication logic takes place as the
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">LFSR</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/lfsr_fib.v">logic</a>
is being synthesized–so that what is actually implemented ends up being
identical to Fig 1 above.</p>

<p>My hope today is that, by specifically stating what the coefficients
of an example <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">LFSR</a>
are, we might be able to examine and understand how an
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">LFSR</a>
works.  Further, as an aside, I’ve seen a lot of examples of how a 3-stage
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">LFSR</a> works
in text books (<code class="highlighter-rouge">TAPS=3'b011</code>).  I wanted this presentation to be different
enough to generate something barely non-trivial, and so this example produces
a longer sequence.  Feel free to let me know if you found this easier to
understand.</p>

<h2 id="working-through-the-states">Working through the states</h2>

<table style="float: left"><caption>Fig 3: Example LFSR States</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/lfsr-fib5-states.svg" alt="States associated with our example 5-bit LFSR" width="120" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Let’s assume that our example starts with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">INITIAL_FILL</code> of one–just like
the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/lfsr_fib.v">implementation</a>
we <a href="/dsp/2017/10/27/lfsr.html">presented earlier</a>.  At each
step, the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">LFSR</a>
works by shifting every bit to the right by one, and then
calculating the top bit.  In our case, that top bit is set by the
sum (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">XOR</a>) of bits <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code>.
You can see the set of states that this produces in Fig 3 on the left.</p>

<p>If you follow this formula, you’ll see that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">00001</code> state is followed by
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">10000</code> state: the new top bit is set by the sum
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">XOR</a>) of <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>–resulting
in <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>.</p>

<p>Since there are no ones in bit positions <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> for a couple of clock
periods, the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">shift
register</a>
just shifts to the right uneventfully until it gets to <code class="highlighter-rouge">00100</code>–the next
time there’s a bit in position <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code>.
The state after <code class="highlighter-rouge">00100</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">10010</code>, since the sum of <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> (position 2) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>
(position 0) is one and that goes into the top bit while the other bits
shift down.</p>

<p>One state later, the register equals <code class="highlighter-rouge">01001</code> and now there’s a bit in position
<code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>, so the state following has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> in the MSB.</p>

<p>We can follow this logic down to <code class="highlighter-rouge">01101</code>.  At this state, instead of adding
<code class="highlighter-rouge">0+1</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">1+0</code> and getting a one as the result, we now have <code class="highlighter-rouge">1+1</code>.  As you
may
<a href="/dsp/2017/10/27/lfsr.html">recall</a>, this addition is done
over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field">GF(2)</a>.  It is equivalent
to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">exclusive or</a>, and so the
new MSB is now <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>.</p>

<p>By this point in time, you should just about have the hang of it.  If not,
feel free to work through the states shown on the left and see if you can
generate each of them.  You may also notice that, after 31 states, the state
returns to our initial state–hence our sequence is <code class="highlighter-rouge">31</code> bits long.</p>

<p>As you transition through all of these states, remember that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">LSB</code> is the
output of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness">pseudorandom</a>
number generator.  Hence, you should be able to
read down the column on the far right of Fig 3 on our left and read out
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness">pseudorandom</a>
numbers that are being produced.</p>

<p>Even better, should you wish to adjust where in this sequence you wish to start,
all you need to do is change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">INITIAL_FILL</code>.  For that matter, if you
sort the <code class="highlighter-rouge">INITIAL_FILL</code> values, you’ll find that every value but zero gets
used–so the register state just determines where you are within the sequence.</p>

<p>Now let’s turn our attention to look at some randomness properties of
this output sequence.
First, let’s count how many <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>’s this sequence produced: <code class="highlighter-rouge">16</code>.  That means
that the sequence has (almost) a probability of <code class="highlighter-rouge">1/2</code> for producing a one.
How about runs?  How many runs of <code class="highlighter-rouge">11</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">00</code> does this sequence produce?
<code class="highlighter-rouge">8</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">7</code> respectively.  This is close to the probability of <code class="highlighter-rouge">1/4</code> that
you’d want.  What about runs of three?  How many times do you find three
<code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>’s in a row, or three <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>’s in a row?  <code class="highlighter-rouge">4</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code> times respectively.
This follows the pattern, and nearly matches the probability of <code class="highlighter-rouge">1/8</code>th
that we would expect.</p>

<p>Judging from these observations, the sequence certainly <em>looks</em> random.
Indeed, it is random <em>enough</em> for most signal processing purposes.
It’s just not random enough for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>–but I’m really not
enough of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptographic</a> expert
to comment further on what it takes to create true
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptographically</a> random numbers.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully running through this example has helped to demystify
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">LFSR</a>s for you.
Because they are so easy to implement, their logic maps so nicely to
just a couple of transistors, and because their results <em>look</em> random,
they have a very important part to play in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">Digital Signal Processing (DSP)</a>.</p>

<p>My intent, however, is to create a module that can output these
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness">pseudorandom</a> values
at 950Mbps–or whatever I can get from my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
to handle at its fastest speed.  To get there, I’m still going to need to create
a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">LFSR</a>
implementation that can produce multiple output bits per clock.  We’ll have
to come back to this topic again, therefore, in order to examine and explain
how to do this.</p>
