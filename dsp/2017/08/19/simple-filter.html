    <p>I’d like to spend some time discussing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">Digital Filtering</a> on
<a href="">this blog</a>.</p>

<p>This is going to be a bit of a difficult topic, however, in that
I don’t intend to discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks-McClellan_filter_design_algorithm">how to
design</a>
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">Digital Filter</a>,
nor do I intend to discuss
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform">how to evaluate</a>
the design of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filter</a>,
nor do I intend to discuss
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing">aliasing</a>.  These are all vital
topics necessary for understanding what a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filter</a> is,
as well as understanding whether or not
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filter</a> even works.
They are also vital topics to understand when comparing the performance of one
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filter</a>
with that of another.  However, these are really topics for a different course.</p>

<p>For now, it’s worth understanding that a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filter</a>
implements a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">discrete convolution</a>,
and that such
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">discrete convolution</a>s
are provably the <em>only</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">signal processing</a>
operations that are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_system">linear</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-invariant_system">shift invariant</a>.
This makes them a very important part of any discussion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">digital signal
processing (DSP)</a>.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that any student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">digital signal
processing</a>
should be able to recognize when a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filter</a>
is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_filter">causal</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIBO_stability">stable</a>,
when it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_phase">linear phase</a>,
and when it has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response">finite (FIR)</a>
or an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response">infinite (IIR)</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response">impulse response</a>.</p>

<p>Our focus in this blog is going to be on how to debug a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filter</a>
so that you can know it works.  To get there, though, we are going to have
to describe some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">filters</a>
so that we have something to debug.  Filters we discuss, together with any
test or debugging logic, will be placed on
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters">GitHub here</a>.</p>

<p>For today, let’s just look at two <em>very</em> simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">filter</a>s:
the simplest non-trivial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response">FIR</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">filter</a>
that I know of, and a simple recursive averager (a type of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response">IIR</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">filter</a>)
that I have found to be very useful.</p>

<h1 id="simple-fir-filter">Simple FIR Filter</h1>

<p>The first
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">filter</a>
we are going to look at may well be the <em>simplest</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response">FIR</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">filter</a>
you will ever come across.  It simply averages adjacent samples together.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-simplfir.png" alt="Equation for a very simple FIR filter" width="242" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">code to implement this
equation</a>
is likewise just as simple:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">initial	delayed = 0;
always @(posedge i_clk)
	if (i_ce)
		delayed &lt;= i_val;
always @(posedge i_clk)
	if (i_ce)
		o_val &lt;= i_val + delayed;</code></pre></figure>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">This filter</a>
is useful for many reasons.  For example, unlike many other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">filter</a>s
that you may study,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">this filter</a>
requires no multiply (DSP) resources within the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>.
The output only
<a href="/dsp/2017/07/21/bit-growth.html">grows by one bit</a>.
Further,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">this filter</a>
can also handle incoming samples at up to the full system clock rate for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>.
Those are the good qualities of
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">this filter</a>.</p>

<p>It is also, however, a very difficult filter to use successfully simply because
its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response">frequency response</a>
rarely describes the performance that you want.  It doesn’t have a
sharp cut off.  Its taps and length are fixed.  Indeed, you might find
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">this filter</a>
that we’ve just implemented to be quite useless.</p>

<p>Before you give up on <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">this simplest
filter</a>,
consider what would happen if
you cascaded several of
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">these filters</a>
together–one right after the other.  For example, suppose you ran your signal
through ten of
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">these filters</a>
in succession.  You would get a filter with a much deeper stopband.</p>

<p>This is the comparison shown in Fig 1 below.  In it, you can see the
predicted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response">frequency
response</a>
of our <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">original simple
filter</a>
above, as well as a similar predicted
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response">frequency response</a>
for the filter that would result from applying that
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">same filter</a>
ten times in a row.  Both filters have been normalized so as to have a unity
response to anything at zero frequency.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1: </caption><tr><td><img src="/img/smplfir.png" alt="Performance of a very simple FIR filter" width="772" /></td></tr></table>

<p>We’ll need come back to this later, when it’s time to determine whether either
filter actually achieves this predicted
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response">frequency response</a>.</p>

<p>While this new cascaded filter is starting to have a nicely acceptable
stop band, nothing remains that might be considered a flat “pass” band
anymore.  Still, the cascaded filter is
easy enough to build and costs so few resources that whenever a cascaded
filter of this type can be used, even if as only a component of other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">filters</a>, it
is often very valuable to do so.  Therefore, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">this simple
filter</a>
finds its best and greatest application in being a component of other,
more powerful, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">filters</a>.</p>

<h1 id="simple-iir-filter">Simple IIR Filter</h1>

<p>The next super-simple filter that I’m going to present is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response">IIR</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">filter</a>.
Specifically, let’s look at a recursive averager.  A recursive
averager keeps an average value at all times, and only adjusts that value
with any input.  Specifically, I like to think of it as a weighted sum of
some percentage of the new input sample plus the remaining percentage of
the last average.</p>

<p>Perhaps an equation will help.  In symbology, a recursive averager is
just:</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-iiravg-defn.png" alt="EQN for a simple recursive averager" width="328" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Where we keep to the standard conventions of <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> being the sample number,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">x[n]</code> being our input and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y[n]</code> being our output.  The new variable here,
alpha, is our means of adjusting how deep or sharp this filter is.  This is
a value between zero and one.  If alpha is one, no averaging takes place.
The closer alpha is to zero, however, the more the filter will average the
input and the longer it will take to converge to an average.  Likewise, the
closer alpha is to zero the less noise the filter will admit to the
average estimate.</p>

<p>With a little manipulation, we can rearrange this filter into something
that’s really easy to compute.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-iiravg-implementation.png" alt="EQN used to implement a simple recursive averager" width="381" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Then, if we insist that alpha be a negative power of two, we can
replace the multiply above with a right shift:</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/eqn-iir-alpha-defn.png" alt="Alpha = 2^{-LGALPHA}" width="168" /></td></tr></table>

<p>You’ll want to use an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_shift">arithmetic shift</a> here,
to mak certain the sign propagates in the case where the difference is
negative.</p>

<p>This leads us to our first design choice: How many clocks can we use to
calculate an answer?  In particular, this recursive averager is going to
require a subtraction followed by an addition.  Both of these operations
<em>need to complete</em> before the next sample.  You can either try to place
this all within a single system tick, or split it between two separate ticks.</p>

<p>If you have new data samples present on every clock tick, you will need
to try the combinational approach I’m going to present below, stuffing all of
the logic into a single clock tick.  This has the unfortunate consequence of
limiting your system clock speed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your data samples will always have at least one
unused clock between them, then you could take one clock tick to calculate
the difference, <code class="highlighter-rouge">x[n]-y[n-1]</code>, and another to update the running average,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">y[n]</code>.</p>

<p>If we suppose that we must do this all within a single clock tick, the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/iiravg.v">following code</a>
will implement this recursive averager.  In the code below, <code class="highlighter-rouge">AW</code>
is the number of bits in the averager, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">IW</code> is the bit-width of the input.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">wire	signed	[(AW-1):0]	difference, adjustment;

// The difference is given by x[n] - y[n-1]
assign	difference = { i_data, {(AW-IW){1'b0}} } - r_average;

// The adjustment is the difference times alpha
assign	adjustment = { {(LGALPHA){(difference[(AW-1)])}},
			difference[(AW-1):(AW-LGALPHA)] };
always @(posedge i_clk)
	r_average &lt;= r_average + adjustment;

assign	o_data = r_average;</code></pre></figure>

<p>You may notice that I could have used the Verilog shift operator and did
not.  Had I done so, then the <code class="highlighter-rouge">adjustment</code> value could have been set with:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">assign	adjustment = difference &gt;&gt;&gt; LGALPHA;</code></pre></figure>

<p>So, how did we do?  We’ll need to come back and test this later to know
for certain.  That in itself is going to need to take some thought.  Just
what is the best way to test a filter?  For now, you can see in Fig 2.
how good we <em>should</em> be doing—if we had truly infinite precision
arithmetic.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2: </caption><tr><td><img src="/img/iiravg.png" alt="Performance of a recursive averager" width="772" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Later, it would be nice to come back and generate this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response">frequency response</a> curve
as a result of measuring how well the filter actually does.  Parameters that
will impact this measurement include not only how many bits are allocated
to the input and output (averager) values, but also how big the input value
truly is.</p>

<p>Unlike the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/smplfir.v">simple</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response">FIR</a>
filter above, applications for this
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters/blob/master/rtl/iiravg.v">simple</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response">IIR</a>
recursive averaging filter abound just about everywhere.</p>

<p>Want to measure a histogram?  Set this up to be an unsigned recursive
averager and then place a <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> into this filter every time your
data is within the bin of interest.</p>

<p>Want to drive an automatic gain control circuit?  Compare the absolute
value of your signal against a fixed threshold.  Set the averager for unsigned
values, and then if your signal’s amplitude is too high you can average a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> into this averager.  If the result is too low, average a <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> into this
averager. You can then use the result to know if you should turn the gain
in your circuitry up or down.</p>

<p>You could also use this to remove any fixed gain in your circuitry.</p>

<p>Indeed, you could even use this circuit coupled with a
<a href="http://andraka.com/files/crdcsrvy.pdf">CORDIC</a>
to measure a single bin (or more) of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response">frequency response</a>
of your system.</p>

<p>This filter is exceptionally versatile as a cheap
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter">low-pass filter</a>.  As an
example of that versatility, it also finds applications in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop">phase lock
loops</a>!</p>

<p>These are all other topics, though, that we’ll need to come back to another
time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Yes, those are the two simplest (non-trivial) filters I know.</p>

<p>Sadly, though, we’re not yet in a position to test these filters to know that
they work.  As a result, we’ll need to come back to the topic of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filtering</a>
once we discuss how to properly test a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filter</a>.
Some of those techniques will depend upon being able to use a
<a href="http://andraka.com/files/crdcsrvy.pdf">CORDIC</a>–something
we have yet to present on this blog.  We’re also going to need to have
a thorough understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)">quantization
noise</a>,
another thing we’ll have to come back and discuss.</p>

<p>This is by no means our final
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filtering</a>,
discussion either!  Many, many other
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
filtering topics remain.  These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How to estimate a filter’s logic resource usage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to build the cadillac of all filters: a dynamic filter whose filter
taps can be set at run time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And then how to build more realistic filters that will actually fit within
your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>’s
logic resources.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Do you get the feeling that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filtering</a>
is a complex topic?  Since it is the most basic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">DSP</a> operation,
we’ll need to spend some time going through it.  Perhaps some well written
examples will help to make this complex topic make more sense.</p>
