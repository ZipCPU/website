    <p>The last time <a href="/dsp/2017/07/11/simplest-sinewave-generator.html">we discussed how to create a
sinewave</a>,
we discussed the way to make a very simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>.
from a <a href="/blog/2017/06/12/minimizing-luts.html">LUT</a>-based
table lookup.  We limited that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>.
to an 8-bit table for simplicity, although it could easily be extended to a
much larger table.</p>

<p>Today, let’s expand this concept to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>.
that uses a quarter wave table
made from Block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a>.  Such a table uses only a fourth of the block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a>
resources required by a full table, although it does require some extra logic
to handle making things look like the full table.</p>

<p>Let’s also build this as an example of how to create pipelined
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a> logic.</p>

<p>We’ll start by describing the algorithm in general, and then build the
algorithm through a series of stages.</p>

<h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2>

<p>The first step is always stepping back and assessing the problem.
If you look at a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>,
such as Fig 1. below, you can separate the full
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>
period into four sections, one quarter wavelength each.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1: Sinewave Symmetry</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/sin-symmetry.png" alt="Sinewave symmetry" width="580" /></td></tr></table>

<p>We’ll leave the first section alone.  This will become our quarter-wave
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>
table.
The second section is identical to the first, only in a backwards order.
Hence, if we reverse our index, we should be able to recover anything from
this quarter wave of the table.  The third and fourth sections are identical
to the first two, only their results will need to be negated afterwards.</p>

<p>Since we are splitting the full wavelength into four sections, the top two
<a href="/dsp/2017/06/15/no-pi-for-you.html">phase</a> bits can be
used to determine which of the four sections we are in.  If the most significant
bit is set, then we’ll want to negate the result.  If the next significant bit
is set, we’ll want to read backwards out of the table.</p>

<p>This quarter wave table runs into a bit of a problem with
<a href="/dsp/2017/06/15/no-pi-for-you.html">phase</a>
quantization, though.  Consider a
<a href="/dsp/2017/06/15/no-pi-for-you.html">phase</a>
quantized table with only 16 entries, such as shown in Fig 2.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2: Sampled Sinewave</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/sin-qtrbroken.png" alt="Sinewave symmetry broken by sampling" width="580" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This table has lost the symmetry that was originally present in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>.
In particular, table[4]’s value is not present in table[0:3].
If we were to use table[3] to represent the missing table[4] value, we
might get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>
looking like Fig 3. below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3: Symmetry can be broken by quantization</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/sin-qtrmisshapen.png" alt="Fixing the broken symmetry by shifting a half a sample in phase" width="580" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Notice how flat the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>
is every time it crosses zero.  It’s not
supposed to be this flat.  The slope of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>
is supposed to be at
a maximum when it crosses zero–not flat. This shape distortion will create
harmonics that we are not expecting if we don’t fix it.</p>

<p>If we instead advance the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>
table entries by a half of a sample of phase each, the result
will have less harmonic distortion. (i.e., it’ll be closer to the right shape,
even if shifted left a touch).  The result would then look like Fig 4.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4: Fixing Symmetry by slipping a half a sample in phase</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/sin-qtrfixed.png" alt="Fixing the broken symmetry by shifting a half a sample in phase" width="580" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The resulting equation for this table is also shown in Fig 4.</p>

<p>The algorithm we want to build will take the first quarter of this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>,
place it into a table, and then use that same table to generate
the other four quarters of the wavelength.</p>

<h2 id="building-the-algorithm">Building the Algorithm</h2>

<p>It’s now time to build this algorithm.  Although the algorithm itself is
quite simple, I’m going to build it in stages and use this as an opportunity
to discuss how to build a pipelined algorithm in general.  This will allow us
to compare several different implementations, and judge between good an bad
approaches.</p>

<p>Our first draft for this algorithm uses a giant case statement:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="mb">2'b10</span><span class="o">:</span>	<span class="n">o_val</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">tbl</span><span class="p">[</span> <span class="n">i_phase</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">PW</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]]</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="mb">2'b11</span><span class="o">:</span>	<span class="n">o_val</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">tbl</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">~</span><span class="n">i_phase</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">PW</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]]</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="k">endcase</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this piece of code, <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_phase</code> is the input
<a href="/dsp/2017/06/15/no-pi-for-you.html">phase</a>
request, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tbl</code> is the quarter wave
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>
table, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_val</code> is the output
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>.
PW is the
<a href="/dsp/2017/06/15/no-pi-for-you.html">phase</a>
width, or equivalently the number of bits in <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_phase</code>.</p>

<p>You may notice that I haven’t used <code class="highlighter-rouge">TBLLEN/4-1-i_phase</code> at all when reversing
the table entries.  Instead, <code class="highlighter-rouge">~i_phase</code> accomplishes the same effect.  To know
why this is relevant, remember the two steps to negating a two’s complement
number: invert all the bits and add one.  In this case, we’d subtract one
after adding one, so we can just invert the bits.  As an example, then, if
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i_phase</code> counts from 0 to 15, <code class="highlighter-rouge">~i_phase</code> would count from 15 back down to 0.</p>

<p>The problem with this big case statement approach is that most block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a>s
are <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp231.pdf">very particular about how they are
accessed</a>.
Extra logic on the index is not allowed, neither is extra logic on the output.
Adding logic in either place can interfere with the synthesis tool and keep
it from recognizing your table as a block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory">ROM</a> in this case).
When dealing with this, I have found the following form to be reliable
among the various hardware’s I have worked with.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">tblvalue</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">tbl</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Perhaps this is simpler than it needs to be, but it does work across
vendors’ tool-suites.</p>

<p>This may also be the time to discuss our pipeline strategy.  Looking over the
<a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">various pipeline
strategies</a>
we posted about earlier, this already looks like the beginning of the
“global CE” approach.  If we look up the examples of where the “global CE”
pipeline strategy makes the most sense, you may recall that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">DSP</a>
logic was one of the common applications of this approach.  Since that’s what
we are building today, we’ll keep the <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code>
line, and add it into the rest of our logic.</p>

<p>Working the simplicity of this block
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> access into our
logic, though, will take some work.  We’ll need to spend a clock to calculate
the index, and another clock after that to deal with the negation.</p>

<p>This brings us to our second approach to our logic.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">begin</span>
	<span class="c1">// First, calculate the table index

	<span class="c1">// Handle the negation afterwards
</span>	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_phase</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">PW</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)])</span>
		<span class="n">o_val</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">tblvalue</span><span class="o">;</span>

		<span class="n">o_val</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span>  <span class="n">tblvalue</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This approach still has some hazards to it.  Perhaps if we drew a data
flow diagram, such as Fig 5 below, these hazards will become be more apparent.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 5: Initial Data Flow Diagram</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/qtrwave-preschedule.svg" alt="Initial data flow diagram" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Let’s work with this flow diagram for a moment.  First, it helps to
separate the data flow variables into clock transitions regions.  (We’ll
show this in Fig 6 below in a moment.)
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i_phase</code> would be in the first clock.  We’ll call this the input clock.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">index</code> is in the next clock, etc.  Once you separate these variables, then
you can see the problem with the negation logic.  This negation flag
needs to come from the
high bit of <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_phase[(PW-1)]</code>, but it has to be available after the table
look up.  To make this problem more apparent, draw vertical lines through
the diagram, dilineating the processing clocks.  Data flows should not cross
through such lines, without being clocked into a new register–else you’ll
have a pipeline bug.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem is to <em>schedule</em> the pipeline logic.
Specifically, we’ll create a register to hold <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_phase[(PW-1)]</code> while
the table index is calculated and the table value is looked up.  We can
implement this with a two stage shift register, captured by <code class="highlighter-rouge">negate[0]</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">negate[1]</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

		<span class="c1">// ...
</span><span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A new data flow diagram for this modified algorithm might look like Fig 6.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 6: Scheduled data flow</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/qtrwave-scheduled.svg" alt="Data flow diagram, with all logic scheduled" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Notice how each variable is now associated with a clock period in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Written out, our logic now looks like:</p>

<p>At this point, we are almost done.  All that’s left is to create a hex
file to be used to crate this table.  This can be done from a simple

<p>Well, not quite.  The problem with this approach is that the table generator
is closely associtated with the Verilog code itself.  In particular, you
can’t change the number of table entries, or for that matter the width of
the table entries, without also adjusting the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/quarterwav.v">Verilog
code</a>.
For this reason, the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/sw/sintable.cpp">C++ generator</a>
program creates both the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/quarterwav.v">Verilog code</a>
and the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/quarterwav.hex">hex table</a>
at the same time.</p>

<p>That’s it!  We’ve now made a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>
generator from just a quarter wave
table.  We’re still going to need to come back to test this table, to build
a test bench and prove that it works, but that’s the basics of the algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This post is one in a small series of posts discussing how to generate a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>.
We’ve already discussed a <a href="/dsp/2017/07/11/simplest-sinewave-generator.html">very simple sinewave
generator</a>,
and we are well on our way to creating and explaining a full blown
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a> implementation.</p>

<p>These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>
generators will then form the basis for testing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital filters</a>
that I intend to discuss and demonstrate as well.</p>

<p>So, while this is the end of this post, in many ways it is only one step
forward in building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">Digital Signal
Proccessing</a>
algorithms within an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>.
Stick around, there’s a lot you can do with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave">sinewave</a>.</p>
