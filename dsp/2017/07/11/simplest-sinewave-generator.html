    <p>Ever need a sine wave when working within an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>?  When
you see the solution to this problem presented below, you may never use a
canned digital synthesizer again.</p>

<h2 id="digital-oscillator-phase">Digital Oscillator phase</h2>

<p>The first step to building this synthesizer is creating the phase input
for the sine wave you wish to create.</p>

<p>We’ve already discussed the ideal units for phase within an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
<a href="/dsp/2017/06/15/no-pi-for-you.html">here</a>.
Basically, you’ll want to keep track of phase in a digital unit that
naturally wraps at your word width, N.  (We’ll arbitrarily choose to use
<code class="highlighter-rouge">N=32</code> for our examples below.)  To convert from radians to these digital
units, simply multiple by 2^N and divide by 2PI.  Likewise to convert from
degrees to these digital units, multiple by 2^N and divide by 360.</p>

<p>Frequency in a digital synthesis system is nothing more than a
change in phase.  Hence, a phase can change by a small delta on
every clock cycle to create the frequency you need.  Something
like the following will work well.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="kt">reg</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>	<span class="n">phase</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="c1">// The initial value is usually irrelevant
</span><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">clock</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="c1">// Allow for an D/A running at a lower speed from your FPGA
</span>	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sample_clock_ce</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">phase</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">phase</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">frequency_step</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This assumes you have a signal (<code class="highlighter-rouge">sample_clock_ce</code>) that is <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> anytime the DAC
needs an output, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> otherwise.  This will allow you to work with
slower signal rates than your system clock rate if necessary.  You can
also just set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sample_clock_ce</code>
value to a constant <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> in order process samples at your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>’s
clock rate.</p>

<p>The right frequency step will depend upon your sample clock rate.
Note, this rate may be slower than your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>’s
system clock rate.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">frequency_step = 2^N * frequency_hz / sample_clock_rate_hz</code></pre></figure>

<p>To make certain we have the formula right, consider a frequency which is
at the Nyquist sample rate of one half of your sample clock rate.  This
frequency should take two steps to wrap back to where it came from.
Looking at the frequency step above, in this case the frequency step would
become <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^(N-1)</code> and two steps (<code class="highlighter-rouge">2*frequency_step</code>) would indeed wrap back
around.  Smaller steps should naturally represent lower frequencies.</p>

<p>Let’s assume a 100MHz sample clock rate for the sake of discussion.</p>

<p>If you choose to represent both phase and frequency step with <code class="highlighter-rouge">N=32</code> bits,
you can represent any frequency between zero and your sample clock rate
divided by two, with a precision given by:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">frequency_precision_hz = sample_clock_rate_hz / 2^N</code></pre></figure>

<p>This is nothing more than solving for the frequency associated with the
difference between two steps.  Equivalently, this is the frequency associated
with a step of one, or the smallest frequency that this approach can generate.</p>

<p>If our system has a 100MHz sample rate clock, a 32-bit frequency step would
allow us to represent <em>any</em> frequency between zero and 50MHz in steps of
about 0.02 Hz.</p>

<p>Not bad, but how about generating a sine wave from this phase?</p>

<h2 id="the-no-more-logic-solution">The “No more logic” Solution</h2>

<p>Since I offered this post as the “Simplest Sine Wave Generator”, I feel
compelled to provide the following even simpler solution:</p>

<p>If you don’t want to use any more logic than your phase generator requires,
then just output the top bit of the phase accumulator.  That’ll give you a
square wave at the frequency you want — with 0.02Hz precision.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">sinewave</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">phase</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As this isn’t really much of a sine wave, but rather a square wave, let’s
continue looking for a better alternative.</p>

<h2 id="digital-oscillator-frequency-output">Digital Oscillator frequency output</h2>

<p>Now that we know the phase of our outgoing digital oscillator, it’s time
to generate the sine wave itself.  Since an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
offers free lookup tables, let’s use them to generate our sine wave.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">clock</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sample_clock_ce</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">sinewave</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">sinewave_table</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">phase</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">]]</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice that we only used the top 8-bits from the phase.  This keeps our logic
simple, while still giving you the full 0.02 Hz resolution we had above.  While
we could use an 8-bit phase accumulator alone, that would’ve only given us
frequency steps in the 400kHz range.</p>

<p>What happens with the 32-bit phase is that eventually the upper 8-bits will
repeat or skip steps as necessary to provide the frequency resolution you want.</p>

<p>Gosh, that was so easy, we could end this post right there.  The task is done!</p>

<p>Before leaving the topic, though, let’s examine two more items: First, let’s
look at the mechanics of setting the sinewave table above, and second let’s
make some rough estimates as to the cost and performance of the synthesizer.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-the-table">How to set the table?</h2>

<p>Since all of the logic is captured within that sinewave table, perhaps we
should spend some time working out how to set the values of the table.
In general, there are three basic approaches for setting the values of the
table.  All three are roughly equivalent in the functionality they will use.</p>

<p>The first approach is to build a giant case statement:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">clock</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sample_clock_ce</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">case</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">phase</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">])</span>
	<span class="mh">8'h00</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">sinewave</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">7'h00</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="mh">8'h01</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">sinewave</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">7'h01</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="mh">8'h02</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">sinewave</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">7'h03</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="o">...</span>
	<span class="mh">8'h40</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">sinewave</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">7'h3f</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="o">...</span>
	<span class="mh">8'h80</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">sinewave</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">7'h00</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="o">...</span>
	<span class="mh">8'hc0</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">sinewave</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">7'h41</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="o">...</span>
	<span class="mh">8'hfe</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">sinewave</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">7'h7d</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="mh">8'hff</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="n">sinewave</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">7'h7f</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="k">endcase</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The synthesizer will turn the logic from this case statement into the table
lookup implementation we want.</p>

<p>The second approach would be to use an actual table read-only register
array, and to set all of the values of the table with individual values
of the sine wave as we want it.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="kt">reg</span>	<span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>	<span class="k">table</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">255</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">;</span>

<span class="k">initial</span> <span class="k">table</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">7'h00</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="k">initial</span> <span class="k">table</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">7'h01</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="k">initial</span> <span class="k">table</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">7'h03</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="k">initial</span> <span class="k">table</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">7'h04</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="k">initial</span> <span class="k">table</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">7'h06</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">//</span> <span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This approach, though, get’s old <em>really</em> fast–especially if you are building
it by hand.  A better approach is to use $readmemh.  (Be aware, in my
experience Xilinx’s ISE can’t handle $readmemh.)</p>

<p>Using $readmemh, you’ll create a hexadecimal text file first.  In our case,
it would probably look something like:</p>

<p>The first part of the line indicates where in the array the coming values
will be placed, whereas the rest of the line consists of values to be placed
in the array separated by spaces.</p>

<p>Then, to use this approach, you’ll need one more line within your
Verilog code to read and set your array:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span> <span class="p">$</span><span class="nb">readmemh</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"table.hex"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">table</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>where <code class="highlighter-rouge">table.hex</code> is the name of your hexadecimal text file.</p>

<p>Given that you are trying to make a sine wave, and that a sine is a rather
complex function, you might want to create this table via a C++ program
instead of by hand (I did).  Just remember: the maximum sine wave value needs
to be +/- 63 since it’s the maximum 7-bit value that has an identical positive
and negative integer value.</p>

<h2 id="estimating-the-cost-of-the-synthesizer">Estimating the Cost of the Synthesizer</h2>

<p>While we’re essentially done here, having presented how to generate a quick
and simple sine wave, let’s spend another moment or too looking at how many
table entries we want (32, 64, 128, or 256), as well as how many bits wide
the elements in the table should be.</p>

<p>In general, this will cost us one look up table per output bit in for each
output sample our sinewave.
However, on the Xilinx architecture, two output bits can share a 6-LUT if
they share the same 5-bit inputs.  Likewise it takes two 6-LUTs to look up
a seven bit value, and four 6-LUTs to look up an 8-bit value.
<a href="/blog/2017/06/12/minimizing-luts.html">[Ref]</a> Let’s examine
the two ends of these possibilities therefore.</p>

<p>If we were to use 5-bit lookup tables, we’d have only <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^5=32</code> entries to the
sine wave table.  A table size of 32 would allow us to divide the unit circle
up into steps separated by <code class="highlighter-rouge">11 degrees</code>.
This means that your sinewave would jump by at most <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.195</code> in value from one
phase to the next.  Representing something with this level of precision only
takes about 4 bits, so this lookup would cost two 6-LUTs total.</p>

<p>That’s pretty cheap.  The 32-bit phase update logic would likely cost more
LUTs (16) than that.</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, suppose we wanted to use 8-bits of phase.
We’d then be able to represent things at <code class="highlighter-rouge">360/2^8=1.4 degree</code> intervals.  The
biggest jump in the sine wave would be about <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.024</code> units. Representing such
a number with that level of precision could easily be done with 7 bits.
Hence, this approach would cost <code class="highlighter-rouge">28 6-LUTs</code>.  That’s still pretty cheap,
although now it costs more than phase calculation.</p>

<h2 id="better-approaches-are-available">Better Approaches are Available</h2>

<p>Our focus today has been on what it takes to generate a <em>really</em> cheap and
simple sine wave within an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>.
At <code class="highlighter-rouge">28 LUTs</code> for the synthesizer and <code class="highlighter-rouge">16 LUTs</code> to track phase, I think we did
just that.</p>

<p>However, if you want to generate a higher quality sine wave, then you
might wish either switch to a larger table, use a quarter wave table, or
even switch from a simple table look up to a full
<a href="http://www.andraka.com/files/crdcsrvy.pdf">CORDIC approach</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should come back and discuss that approach later?
<a href="http://www.andraka.com/files/crdcsrvy.pdf">CORDIC</a>’s
aren’t that hard to build, and they make an excellent lesson for the
beginner in how to design
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
based algorithms.</p>
