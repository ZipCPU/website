  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>We just started a discussion of
<a href="/dsp/2017/07/19/linear-upsampling.html">linear-upsampling</a>.
In many ways the <a href="/dsp/2017/07/19/linear-upsampling.html">linear-upsampling</a>
algorithm is much like <em>any</em> DSP algorithm: samples come in, multiplies, adds,
and subtracts get applied, and samples go out.
Like any other algorithm using these operations, every add or multiply
will increase the number of bits required to represent the result.
So it seems only fitting to look at bit growth, so we can know how many bits
to allocate for our internal results.</p>

<p>Since dropping bits, once grown, is even more complicated than just tracking
bit growth, we’ll save that discussion for it’s own post later.</p>

<p>If you’ve never dealt with, or heard of, bit growth before then it can be
confusing.  It doesn’t need to be so.  As we’ll show here, there are only
two rules you need to keep track of.  Follow the two basic rules, and you
should be okay.  That said, we’ll present three rules today.</p>

<p>My basic approach for understanding bit growth is to look
at the extremes of any <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> bit arithmetic operation, and see how many bits
it takes to represent that extreme.  Indeed, if you ever get confused, just
come back to this approach and examine the extremes of the values you
are calculated within your application.</p>

<p>Looking at the extremes in the representation, an <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> bit number,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>, can be any one of a range of signed or unsigned values.  In the
case of signed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement">two’s
complement</a>
values, the range of an <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> bit number is given by,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">-2^(N-1) &lt;= a &lt;= 2^(N-1) -1</code></pre></figure>

<p>Hence, a four bit number can represent values between -8 and +7 inclusive.</p>

<p>Likewise the range of an unsigned value <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> bits wide is,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">0 &lt;= a &lt; 2^(N) -1</code></pre></figure>

<p>and a four bit unsigned number can represent values from 0 to 15.</p>

<p>If you add, subtract, or multiply numbers at the ends of these ranges,
by how much must <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> be increased to capture the new result without overflow?</p>

<p>There are a couple of cases you might not consider along the way, and so I’ll
note these below and keep this page updated as a reminder of what the corner
cases are.</p>

<h2 id="add-one-bit-on-every-add">Add one bit on every add</h2>

<p>The rule for addition is that adding two <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> bit numbers together requires
an extra bit to represent the result.  Let’s test this to see if this is
true:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">(2^N-1) + (2^N-1) = 2^(N+1)-2</code></pre></figure>

<p>That certainly works for the positive end of the range, what about the negative
end?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">-2^N - 2^N = -2^(N+1)</code></pre></figure>

<p>So, at the negative end we are good with adding an additional bit as well.</p>

<p>If you know that the numbers you will be adding will have different signs,
then no bit growth is needed, since the absolute value of the result will
tend towards zero rather than increasing.  I’ve just never found an
application that can use this nuance.</p>

<p>Unsigned numbers are roughly the same, with exception that you need to be
careful when subtracting two unsigned numbers.  The problem here being that
the result might be negative.
This means that, unless you can guarantee that the result will
not overflow (i.e. go below zero), you will need to add a sign bit.  Hence,
again, one bit of growth–but this comes with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement">alternate representation
(two’s complement)</a> as well.</p>

<p>So the rule of adding one bit per addition (or) subtraction has special case
we’ll need to be careful of, where the data representation changes as well,
but otherwise it holds.</p>

<p>What if you are adding values with different bit widths?  Suppose you wish to
add an <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> bit number to an <code class="highlighter-rouge">M</code> bit number?  As before, the answer can be found
by examining the extremes.  If you add the two positive extremes:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">2^(N-1)-1+2^(M-1)-1 &lt; 2^(N) - 1</code></pre></figure>

<p>as long as <code class="highlighter-rouge">M&lt;N</code>.  The same is true for the negative extreme.  Here, then,
the rule is that the output must have one more bit than the widest of the
two input numbers.</p>

<p>Now, let’s apply this to bits within an FPGA.  When building DSP algorithms,
you’ll want to adjust them for the appropriate width <em>later</em>.  That way you
can write one routine that works for multiple bit-widths, and may even work
across multiple projects.  Hence, you’ll want to declare your various bit
widths as parameters.  We’ll use this approach for our <a href="/dsp/2017/07/19/linear-upsampling.html">linear
interpolator</a>,
as well.)  For example, if you want to add two number, <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>,
together, you might do something like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">module add(i_clk, a, b, out);
parameter	AWIDTH=16, BWIDTH=4;
		// Output width is given by one more than the maximum of A's
		// width and B's width.  Make this a localparam so that
		// it can't be overridden
localparam	OUTWID = (AWIDTH &gt; BWIDTH) ? (AWIDTH + 1) : (BWIDTH+1);

input	wire	[(AWIDTH-1):0]	a;
input	wire	[(BWIDTH-1):0]	b;
output	reg	[(OUTWID-1):0]	out;

always @(posedge i_clk)
	out &lt;= a + b;</code></pre></figure>

<p>This captures all of the logic we just discussed above: adding one bit on
any addition or subtraction.</p>

<h2 id="long-strings-of-addition">Long strings of addition</h2>

<p>Since the fundamental DSP operation is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">convolution</a>, and since
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">convolutions</a>
require adding lots of numbers together, this creates a special case of
bit growth that needs to be discussed.</p>

<p>Imagine you had <code class="highlighter-rouge">K</code> words, <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> bits each, that all needed to be added together.
If you applied the rule above, you might allocate <code class="highlighter-rouge">K+N</code> bits to the result.
While the result would work, it’s also more bits than you need.</p>

<p>As before, we’ll look at the extremes.  What happens when you add <code class="highlighter-rouge">K</code> extreme
values together?  We’ll consider only the signed case, since the unsigned
case is roughly the same:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">K * (2^(N-1)-1)</code></pre></figure>

<p>Before taking the next step, let’s imagine a number of bits, <code class="highlighter-rouge">M</code>, that can hold
the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">K</code>, such that:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">K &lt;= 2^M</code></pre></figure>

<p>Further, we want <code class="highlighter-rouge">M</code> to be the smallest number possible so that this inequality
holds.  Mathematically, we might say that,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">M = ceil(log(K)/log(2))</code></pre></figure>

<p>or equivalently that <code class="highlighter-rouge">M</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">ceiling (smallest integer above or equal
to)</a>
of the base two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">logarithm</a>
of <code class="highlighter-rouge">K</code>.  In simpler terms, it’s just the log (base
two) of <code class="highlighter-rouge">K</code>, rounded up to the nearest integer.</p>

<p>Now, using this number, we know that</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">K &lt;= 2^M</code></pre></figure>

<p>and so that,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">K * (2^(N-1)-1) &lt;= (2^M)*(2^(N-1)-1) = 2^(M+N-1)-1</code></pre></figure>

<p>And that’s our defining case.  When adding a large number of values together,
all having the same bit width, the number of bits required to hold the result
is given by the original number of bits plus the log, base two, of the
number of elements added together.</p>

<p>We’ll save the Verilog example for when we build an FIR filter on this blog.</p>

<h2 id="add-the-number-of-bits-on-every-multiply">Add the number of bits on every multiply</h2>

<p>Let’s now look at multiplying two numbers.  We’ll start by looking at signed
multiplication, but then look at unsigned multiplication before finishing.</p>

<p>Our first step will be to examine
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement">two’s complement</a>
multiplication.  Suppose we multiply
a signed <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> bit number with a signed <code class="highlighter-rouge">M</code> bit number.  If you multiply
the two largest of these numbers together, the result will fit in <code class="highlighter-rouge">N+M-1</code> bits:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">(2^(N-1) -1) * (2^(M-1) -1) = 2^(N+M-2) -2^(M-1) - 2^(N-1) +1 &lt; 2^(N+M-2)-1</code></pre></figure>

<p>Don’t forget to check the other extreme!  Multiplying the two most negative
numbers together yields a positive result, so this is an important check:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">(-2^(N-1)) * (-2^(M-1)) = 2^(N+M-2) &lt; 2^(N+M-1)</code></pre></figure>

<p>You may note that 2^(N+M-2) just barely doesn’t fit in <code class="highlighter-rouge">N+M</code>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement">two’s complement</a>
bits, so this becomes the defining case: <code class="highlighter-rouge">N+M</code> bits are required to hold the
output, although fitting within <code class="highlighter-rouge">N+M-1</code> bits will be more common.</p>

<p>In Verilog, multiplying two signed numbers together would look like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">module multiply(i_clk, a, b, out);
parameter	AWIDTH=16, BWIDTH=4;
		// Output width is given by one more than the maximum of A's
		// width and B's width
localparam	OUTWID = (AWIDTH + BWIDTH);

input	signed wire	[(AWIDTH-1):0]	a;
input	signed wire	[(BWIDTH-1):0]	b;
output	signed reg	[(OUTWID-1):0]	out;

always @(posedge i_clk)
	out &lt;= a * b;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice again that, just like the add, we allow the bit width to be specified
(and overruled) by a parameter.  This allows us to adjust the bit-width
later.</p>

<p>Now let’s consider unsigned multiplication.  In this case, we only need to check
the positive edge of the interval,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">(2^(N) -1) * (2^(M) -1) = 2^(N+M) -2^(M) - 2^(N) +1 &lt; 2^(N+M)-1</code></pre></figure>

<p>As before, <code class="highlighter-rouge">N+M</code> bits are required to hold the product of an <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> bit number
with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">M</code> bit number.  Indeed, the Verilog code for doing this is the same
as before, with the only exception that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">signed</code> tag needs to be
removed to do unsigned multiplication.</p>

<h2 id="rules-to-live-by">Rules to Live By</h2>

<p>Let’s summarize our rules here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When adding two numbers, increase the number of bits in the result by one.</p>

    <p>Be careful of subtracting unsigned numbers.  Your new bit may change
you from unsigned to signed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement">two’s
complement</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When adding long strings of numbers, each with an identical number of bits,
such as you would do when implementing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution">convolution</a>
the bit growth goes as the log of the length of the string, rather than one
bit per addition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When multiplying two numbers, store the output in a register having as many
bits within it as the two multiplicands had combined.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We’re not quite ready to finish our lesson on <a href="/dsp/2017/07/19/linear-upsampling.html">Linear
Interpolation</a>,
though.  We still need to discuss</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How to <a href="/dsp/2017/07/22/rounding.html">drop bits</a>
when processing signals, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to <a href="/dsp/2017/07/24/dsp-debugging.html">debug DSP
algorithms</a>.</p>

    <p>The approach you will need to debug a DSP based algorithm is very distinctly
different from the tools necessary to debug the rest of your logic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Then we can come back and finish building our
<a href="/dsp/2017/07/19/linear-upsampling.html">linear interpolator</a>.</p>

<p>If you see any mistakes in the rules above, or any rules regarding bit growth
that I’ve missed, please feel free to comment and note them below.</p>
