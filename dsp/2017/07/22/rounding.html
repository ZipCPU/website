    <p>Every time I’ve built a signal processing system, I’ve struggled with bit-width.
<a href="/dsp/2017/07/21/bit-growth.html">Bit width grows</a> when you
apply a filter.  It grows when you add two streams together.  It grows when
you multiply your signal by an sine wave or a complex exponential.  Indeed,
<a href="/dsp/2017/07/21/bit-growth.html">bit growth</a> alone can be
a challenge to keep track of.</p>

<p>If you are not careful, you will make the problem worse like I first did when
you try to deal with it.</p>

<p>You see, on my first
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">Digital
Signal Processing (DSP)</a>
project, I just got rid of the bits I didn’t need by simply dropping them.  I’d
take the result of whatever arithmetic I had accomplished, and I’d only keep
the top <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> bits.  Problem solved, right?</p>

<p>Not quite.  While that approach kept the number of bits I was using in
bounds, it also created artifacts at DC that confused both myself and the
team of individuals I was working with.  Did the system really have an
uncontrolled DC bias?  Where did this bias come from?  Did we need better
analog filtering?  Better bias control up front?</p>

<p>The answer was none of the above.  The problem was that I had not properly
handled dropping bits, although it took building
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">my own</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT)</a> to realize I
had a problem.</p>

<p>So let’s examine how to round numbers within an FPGA.
We’ll examine several forms of rounding, and look at how each of these
forms biases the result one way or another from true. Along the way, we’ll
use consider diagrams, similar Fig 1 below, to explain what’s happening.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1: The need for Rounding</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/rounding/rounding-tbd.svg" alt="Outlining the rounding discussion" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This figure shows a series of numbers, and a series of boxes.  The boxes
represent the incoming values, and the numbers above represent the possible
output values.  They are placed above the box where the operation would be
exact.</p>

<p>If you look closer, you’ll notice that there are eight boxes per output
integer.  The boxes that line up exactly are under the arrows, and they are
also shown in color, to representing the integer they are assigned to. 
This leaves seven boxes between exact results that need to be determined.</p>

<p>This is the issue of rounding.  When given a value (represented by one of
these boxes) between two integers, how shall it be mapped to one of the
integers above?  We’ll represent individual chosen mappings via color below,
so you can see and get a feel the concept.</p>

<p>With this background, we can return to our question: how to go from
too many bits, to just the right number?</p>

<h1 id="go-for-easy-truncation">Go for easy: truncation</h1>

<p>The first way of dropping bits may be the easiest … just get rid of any
excess bits.  This was what I had done originally.  Consider, if you have
a data values <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_data</code> coming in with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IWID</code> (input width) bits, and you want
to create a data value with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OWID</code> bits, why not just grab the top <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OWID</code> bits?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">assign</span> <span class="n">o_truncate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="p">)];</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you just want something quick and simple, this approach works.</p>

<p>Well, sort of.</p>

<p>Maybe not really.</p>

<p>It’s what I used before I started working on an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">FFT
algorithm</a>.  When I built my testbench
for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">FFT</a>, one of my inputs would
be a sine wave.  I expected as an output a single non-zero value at or near the
frequency of the sine wave.  While I got the value I was looking for at the
frequency of the sine wave, I also kept getting values at DC that didn’t make
sense to me.</p>

<p>When I dug into this, I discovered that dropping bits in this fashion biases
the result by about a half of a bit in the negative direction.  If you consider
Fig 1 below, you can see this effect since it shows how the area covered by
each number is biased to the right of the number.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2: Truncation effects</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/rounding/rounding-bytruncation.svg" alt="Effect of dropping bits by truncation" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>So it was working on this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">FFT algorithm</a>
that sent me looking for alternatives.  The best explanation I found of the
various alternatives was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">wikipedia’s rounding
page</a>.  Here, we’ll just explain
the types of rounding discussed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">there</a>,
and show some Verilog examples of how to do each.</p>

<h1 id="basic-rounding-round-half-up">Basic rounding: Round half up</h1>

<p>My next approach to dropping bits was to add a half.  This was the type of
rounding I learned to do as a child in grade school. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">Wikipedia calls this</a>
“round half up”.</p>

<p>The Verilog code for doing this is nice, in that it only needs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OWID+1</code> bits
to work on.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">w_halfup</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
		<span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">}}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">}}</span> <span class="o">}</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">o_halfup</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">w_halfup</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="p">)];</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Many of the other approaches we’ll discuss will require adding numbers to all
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IWID</code> bits, so this approach turns out to be simpler than the other
rounding approaches below.</p>

<p>While this approach worked a lot better, it still leaves a bias within the data
values.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3: Round Half-Up</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/rounding/rounding-halfup.svg" alt="Round Half-Up" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>To understand what the problem is, consider the bins around our output numbers,
as shown in Fig 4 below:</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4: Illustrating the problem with rounding</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/rounding/rounding-problem.svg" alt="Illustrating the problem(s) with rounding" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>We might argue that every bin should be attached to the output value “nearest”
to it.</p>

<p>That leaves the bins or boxes in the exact center, exactly located between
any two integer values.</p>

<p>If you connect all those between bins to the integers
on the right, you’ll create the bias we saw in Fig 3.  Sure, it’s less than
the bias in Fig 2, bit its still a bias.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you connect all these in-between bins to the integer
values on the left (round half down), you’ll create a similar bias–only
in the other direction.</p>

<p>Several types of rounding will fix this.</p>

<h1 id="round-towards-zero">Round towards zero</h1>

<p>One unbiased method of rounding is to round towards zero, shown in Fig 5 below.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 5: Rounding towards zero</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/rounding/rounding-tozero.svg" alt="Rounding towards zero" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In this case, we select the integer nearest zero for our midpoint.</p>

<p>Doing this in Verilog is simple, too:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">w_tozero</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">}}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)],</span>
			<span class="o">{</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">{!</span><span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)]</span><span class="o">}}}</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">o_tozero</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">w_tozero</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="p">)];</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>An almost identical method is to round away from zero.  In this case, the
mid point values are assigned to the integer nearest them that is farthest
from zero.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">w_fromzero</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">}}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)],</span>
			<span class="o">{</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)]</span><span class="o">}}}</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">o_fromzero</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">w_fromzero</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="p">)];</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The problem with these two approaches is that they will subtly change
the amplitude of your signal.</p>

<p>Is there a better approach?</p>

<h1 id="convergent-rounding-round-half-to-even">Convergent rounding: Round half to even</h1>

<p>Thankfully, I didn’t need to invent a better approach.  Several solutions to the
rounding problem were already listed for me in a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">Wikipedia</a> article.</p>

<p>The better approach that I have found is called convergent rounding, although
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even">Wikipedia</a> gives it many other names.
Perhaps “Round half to even” is the most
descriptive.  Convergent rounding starts out in an identical fashion to the
more traditional rounding (round half up), with the exception of when you are
at the exact half way point.  In that case, convergent rounding rounds towards
the nearest <em>even</em> integer, as shown in Fig 6 below.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 6: Convergent Rounding</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/rounding/rounding-toeven.svg" alt="Illustrating convergent rouding" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>If you count the number of input bins assigned to each output integer, you’ll
notice that 0 gets 9 bins, 1 gets 7, 2 gets 9, etc.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Verilog code to perform this operation is no more difficult
than rounding towards (or away from) zero.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">w_convergent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
			<span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">}}</span><span class="p">,</span>
				<span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">IWID</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">OWID</span><span class="p">)],</span>

<p>You may notice that these last several forms of rounding required a single clock
delay to calculate the answer.  That extra clock is required to perform a
full word’s worth of addition.  This is the addition required to get the carry
to propagate through the entire input number.</p>

<p>If you can’t afford the extra clock, consider just dropping the extra bit, as
in our first example.</p>

<p>By the way, I’m not the only one who likes this approach.  According to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even">Wikipedia</a>
article, it is the “default rounding mode used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE
754</a> computing functions”.  Recognize
that standard?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> is the
standard that defines how floating point is done within your computer.</p>

<h1 id="the-dblclock-fft">The DblClock FFT</h1>

<p>In my motivation above, I mentiond the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">FFT</a> I had built earlier.  This
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">FFT</a> is built a bit differently from a
lot of the other Verilog cores I’ve worked with and those I’ve come across. 
In particularly, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">dblclockfft</a>
project consists not in a Verilog core, but rather the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/sw/fftgen.cpp">C++ code</a>
necessary to build a Verilog core.  This gives it the flexibility to build
any <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">FFT</a> size or bit-width you want.</p>

<p>It’s also a bit of a niche product, since it takes two input samples per clock.</p>

<p>In other words, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">dblclockfft</a> can be
configured for arbitrary FFT sizes (subject to the amount of logic on your
device), incoming and outgoing bit widths, as well as the number of hardware
multiplies used internally.  It also allows you (internally) to configure
the type of rounding that will be used within the resulting algorithm.</p>

<p>It was while testing <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">this FFT core</a>
that I noticed sinewaves going into the core were producing results on the
DC bin coming out.  The problem, when fully traced out, came down to rounding.
Using the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/sw/fftgen.cpp">C++ core generator
program</a>,
I then tested and compared multiple rounding
approaches against each other, and decided upon the convergent rounding
approach discussed above.  (That’s why the type of rounding can be configured
internally.)</p>

<p>As a side note, with just a touch of care and feeding the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">dblclockfft</a> could be adjusted to
meet anyone’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>
needs.  Want a single sample in per clock?  It’s <em>almost</em>
there.  Want a real (vice complex)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>?
It only needs one additional module.
How about running an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>?
in a non-pipelined mode, with only two hardware
multiplies required <em>in total</em>, and the size cost turned into a block RAM cost? 
Most of the pieces are there for that as well.  In other words, with a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">touch
of support</a>, that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">FFT
project</a> could be made <em>very</em> generic.</p>

<h1 id="next-steps">Next steps</h1>

<p>This particular post is actually only one in a series of posts building up to a
working linear upsampling interpolator.  We’ve already discussed the basic
<a href="/dsp/2017/07/19/linear-upsampling.html">upsampling linear
interpolator</a>, and
<a href="/dsp/2017/07/21/bit-growth.html">bit growth</a> within it. 
Now that we understand rounding, our next step in building this
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">interpolator</a>
will be to discuss how to debug a DSP algorithm.</p>
