    <p>We’ve now written a <a href="/dsp/2017/07/19/linear-upsampling.html">linear upsampling
algorithm</a>, and
discussed how to handle both <a href="/dsp/2017/07/21/bit-growth.html">bit
growth</a> and
<a href="/dsp/2017/07/22/rounding.html">rounding</a> within it.  It’s
now time to debug it, and prove that it does (or doesn’t) work.</p>

<p>The problem I’ve always had at this point is that my favorite tools don’t
work very well for this task.</p>

<p>My favorite tool for debugging my own programs has always been (f)printf().
Sure, I’ve used <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb">gdb</a>, and even its
friendlier cousin <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ddd">ddd</a>.  It’s just that
these two debuggers have not been my favorite tool.  (f)printf() is still my
favorite tool when it comes to debugging logic with
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.
In the case of HDL, <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a> comes in as a
close second.</p>

<p>None of these approaches has ever worked well for me when debugging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">Digital
Signal Processing (DSP)</a>
algorithms like this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">linear
interpolator</a>.</p>

<p>There’s just no substitute for the ability to plot waveforms, raw, processed,
and even partially processed, on an ad-hoc basis.  This ad-hoc capability
is available through <a href="https://www.gnu.org">GNU</a>’s
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>, and to some extent with 
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">gnuplot</a>.  Of these three, my favorite has been
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>–mostly because I cannot
afford <a href="https://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll return to examining our
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">linear interpolator</a>, 
but this time we’ll place it within a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.cpp">test
harness</a>
to find out whether or not it works, and to see why or why not.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.cpp">test harness</a>
is the topic of this post.</p>

<h2 id="test-points">Test Points</h2>

<p>We know what we want our <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">linear
interpolator</a>
to do.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">That theory</a> was
well developed before we started.  Hence, no <em>validation</em> is required.  What we
want to know instead is whether or not our <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">linear
interpolator</a>
is coming up with the right answers.  That is, we want to <em>verify</em> that our
Verilog logic works.</p>

<p>The easiest way to find any errors within our logic is going to be to build a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lintest.m">duplicate set of logic</a>
to do the <em>exact</em> same thing, and then to compare the results to see if they
match.  While the approach isn’t perfect, the likelihood that both test
fixture <em>and</em> system under test will be in error is much smaller than just
the one being in error.</p>

<p>That means we are going to need to know:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The input(s) to our routine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any intermediate results calculated by the routine, such as the slope the
routine generated, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The output of the routine.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The trick is that all of these values need to be lined up together in order
for <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>
to repeat the calculation and compare the result.</p>

<p>This isn’t quite as simple as it sounds, particularly because the outputs of
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">linear
interpolator</a>,
as we built it, aren’t evenly spaced every <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> ticks apart, but rather they get
produced in groups or bunches.  Hence, when you look at them in 
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>, you may easily struggle to “see”
the waveform is that the interpolator is actually producing, as seen in Fig 1
below.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1: GTKWave view of the interpolated signal</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/lininterp-gtkwave.png" alt="Example GTKWave window showing the output of a linear interpolator" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>So, we’re going to add to our <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.cpp">test
harness</a>
a quick capability to write a debugging file out.  We’ll write this file
as a series of 32-bit integer binary values–something
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a> will have no problems ingesting.
For test purposes, we’ll also use some logic within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">core</a> 
to keep the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.cpp">test
harness</a>
test points aligned.</p>

<p>Our goal will be to produce two data sets, using
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>,
and to plot them one on top of the other.  The first line on the graph will
be our alternate calculation, done within
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>,
showing what the linear interpolators result <em>should</em> be.  The second line
will plot what the result <em>actually is</em>.  If the two functions
lie on top of each other, then we’ll know our algorithm works.</p>

<h2 id="the-test-harness">The Test Harness</h2>

<p>Let’s look through how the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.cpp">test
harness</a>
for this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">linear
interpolator</a>
is put together.  While in many ways it’s just like any other
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
based test harness, one thing that makes it very unique is what happens
<em>after</em> the clock tick.  To keep this simple, we’ll work in broad brush
strokes to explain how this works, skipping large portions of it.  If this
gets confusing, please look back at our <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">first Verilator
tutorial</a>, or
even the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.cpp">test
harness</a>
itself to see what’s going on.</p>

<p>To set this up, at the beginning of <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.cpp">the test
harness</a>’s
main routine, I created a debugging output file and pointer:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="k">const</span>   <span class="kt">char</span>    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">DBGFNAME</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"dbgfp.32t"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">FILE</span>    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">dbg_fp</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="n">dbg_fp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fopen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DBGFNAME</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">"w"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This file will also need to get closed when we’re all done.</p>

<p>Second, it turns out that picking the right interpolation frequency is
rather important.  You want your input clock to be fairly low, and your
output clock fairly high if you want to make the pretty looking pictures below.
Testing with an output clock rate very near the input clock rate can also be
very useful and instructive as well, it just tends to be harder to understand
the results.</p>

<p>For this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.cpp">test
harness</a>,
I set the input sample rate to be one input sample for every forty clock ticks.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="kt">unsigned</span>	<span class="n">iclocks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Third, we need to pick a signal to evaluate.  I chose a sine wave.  I set this
to be at a fairly low frequency, 24 input samples per wavelength, because it
will help to reveal any problems with our interpolator.  Higher frequencies
may also help, but they’ll test and reveal a different set of errors.</p>

<p>The sine wave function call takes place between one input sample and the next.
To create the desired frequency, we’ll step the phase forward by some angle
on every input sample.  In the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.cpp">test
harness</a>
code snippet below, I have called this step <code class="highlighter-rouge">dphase</code>, for a <em>phase difference</em>
or phase step.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="c1">// dphase is the phase increment of our test sinewave.  It's really
// represented by a phase step, rater than a frequency.  The phase

// easier to track later.

	<span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice how <code class="highlighter-rouge">dphase</code> increments the actual phase, <code class="highlighter-rouge">dtheta</code> (double valued
theta).  Further, any time <code class="highlighter-rouge">dtheta</code> wraps, we just subtract one to keep it
between zero and one.  Then, when an input sample is required, we use this
phase as an input to the cosine function.</p>

<p>Fourth, there’s no reason to run this simulation until your PC needs to be
rebooted.  Hence, we’ll only look at a finite number of clock ticks before
halting our simulation:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="k">while</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">clocks</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">MAXTICKS</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="n">clocks</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, the real important part of any <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.cpp">DSP
debugger</a>,
in <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
(or any C++ algorithm for that matter), is to output values that
you can then ingest into <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>.</p>

<p>For our example, we’ll pick the inputs and outputs of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">linear
interpolator</a>,
together with four internal values.  These will all be converted to signed
32-bit integers, and dumped to a file: six outputs at a time.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="c1">// If the core is producing an output, then let's examine

<p>You’ll see in the next section, when we discuss the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lintest.m">test script</a>,
why we chose a constant number of values, and a common type for all of these
same values.</p>

<h2 id="the-octave-script">The Octave Script</h2>

<p>The first step to processing this data within 
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>
is to load the information into
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>.
You’ll notice that all of the data we produced was uniform in
type, and all of the records had the same number of samples, six.  This
makes loading the file into octave very easy.  Indeed, it’s so easy that
I usually do it by hand for the first several rounds of debugging, before
I turn it into <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lintest.m">a script</a>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-matlab" data-lang="matlab"><span class="n">fid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">fopen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'dbgfp.32t'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'r'</span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>I think if I needed multiple data types, I’d probably first promote values to
the largest type, and if that didn’t work I’d create multiple data files.</p>

<p>Now that our data has been ingested into
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>,
let’s see if we can
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lintest.m">redo the arithmetic</a>
the FPGA is supposed to do, only this time in double precision math.</p>

<p>In this case, all the required math was discussed in our
<a href="/2017/07/19/linear-upsampling.html">first post</a>, so
here we just repeat it.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-matlab" data-lang="matlab"><span class="n">redo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">o_last</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">o_next</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">o_last</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.*</span><span class="n">o_offset</span><span class="p">)/</span><span class="n">mxv</span><span class="p">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>One key difference in this version, from the discussion of how to do this
within the FPGA, is the divide by <code class="highlighter-rouge">mxv*2</code>.  This comes back to a bit growth
issue, but a fixed vs floating point version of it.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_offset</code>, as <a href="/2017/07/19/linear-upsampling.html">you may
recall</a>,
is an integer being used to represent a value between zero and one.
Hence, we need to divide it by its scale factor to turn it back into a floating
point value between zero and one.</p>

<p>We’re also dividing our result, and indeed our input values as well, by <code class="highlighter-rouge">mxv</code>
so that we can plot the result between more reasonable bounds.</p>

<p>All that remains is to plot the results and see how well (or poorly) we did.</p>

<p>Plotting data like this will <em>really</em> help you <em>see</em> problems in your code,
and by seeing them, recognizing them will become easier to do.</p>

<h2 id="bugs-i-found">Bugs I found</h2>

<p>I really dislike sharing buggy code on this Blog.  Sorry.  As a result, I’m
not going to show how how I messed this up along the way. 
(My code always works the first time, right?)  Therefore, if you examine the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">linear interpolation example Verilog
code</a>,
you’re not likely to find any bugs within it.  (I won’t put it past you,
though–as of today, I’ve only bench tested this component.)</p>

<p>In reality, there were bugs within it when I first simulated it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first bug I struggled with was a bit-width bug.</p>

    <p>At several points during the linear interpolation algorithm, bits need to
be selected and <a href="/dsp/2017/07/22/rounding.html">even dropped</a>.</p>

    <p>When I first ran this test, I dropped some of the more significant bits
along the way.  The result looked <em>very</em> <em>jumbled</em>.   Further, since I was
trying to view a sinewave in
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>,
they looked even more jumbled.  If you think you are
struggling with this problem at all, try increasing the bit width (there’s
a reason it’s set to 28 for this test), and backing away from full range to
see if it helps.</p>

    <p>Because the number of input bits in our test is so large, this problem
can be see to have a clear signature (now) in Fig 2.</p>

    <table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2: Internal bit selects in error</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/lininterp-badbits.png" alt="Linear interpolator bugs: errant bit selects" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

    <p>Once the algorithm works, you can remove any extra bits that were needed to
test and prove it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Signed multiplies are different from unsigned multiplies</p>

    <p>This was another of my problems.</p>

    <p>If you aren’t familiar with this problem, the consider multiplying some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement">two’s complement</a> 3’bit
numbers together.  A <code class="highlighter-rouge">-2</code> would be represented as <code class="highlighter-rouge">3'b110</code>.  Multiplying <code class="highlighter-rouge">-2</code>
times <code class="highlighter-rouge">-2</code> should be a six bit <code class="highlighter-rouge">-4</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">6'b111100</code> (Remember to
<a href="/dsp/2017/07/21/bit-growth.html">add the bit widths</a>
of the inputs together to get the final bitwidth.)
However, if you use unsigned multiplication then <code class="highlighter-rouge">3'b110</code> (6) times
<code class="highlighter-rouge">3'b110</code> (6) is 6’b100100 (36) not 6’b111100.  See the difference?</p>

    <p>You’ll notice this problem when everything works properly for positive
numbers, and then fails for negative numbers.  Indeed, if you ever see
a result where things work in sections but not entirely,
then you might want to check for this bug.</p>

    <table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3: Unsigned vs Signed Multiplication Error</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/lininterp-badsign.png" alt="Unsigned vs Signed Multiplication Error" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

    <p>To fix this, I needed to declare the inputs to the multiply to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">signed</code>
wire’s or registers.
I also needed to extend the unsigned time offset by a zero bit, to make
sure it had the right sign.  Once done, this bug cleared up as well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can find the final working <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">linear interpolator
here</a>. 
The two bugs listed above have been fixed.  As a result, the interpolator’s
test bench output now looks like Fig 4 below.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4: A Working Interpolator</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/lininterp-working.png" alt="Working Linear Interpolator Output" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Not bad, huh?  In fact, it’s just the result we wanted.</p>

<h2 id="when-simulation-doesnt-match-realtiy">When Simulation doesn’t Match Realtiy</h2>

<p>Since I’ve only tested this linear interpolation core under simulation, there
may well be some residual problems if/when I try it on some actual hardware. 
It’s just a fact of life.</p>

<p>If you ever find yourself in that situation, then just repeat the same test,
or one similar, but this time do it within the hardware itself.  Remember,
that was what your <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">internal
scope</a> was for, right?</p>

<p>You can also use the debugging method <a href="/digilent/2017/05/29/fft-debugging.html">discussed
here</a>, should you
have problems where this works in simulation but not in hardware.  Further,
feel free to post any bugs below, or on the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/issues">issues
page</a> for the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation">GitHub repo</a>, and I’ll
fix anything you point out.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>This example should illustrate for you two important lessons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To determine if an FPGA algorithm is working, create another (similar)
non-FPGA algorithm and test the two against each other.</p>

    <p>In this example, we compared an
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lintest.m">script</a>’s
version of our interpolator (we called this <code class="highlighter-rouge">redo</code>) with the outputs of our
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/rtl/lininterp/lininterp.v">Verilog
interpolator</a>.
When they matched, as in Fig 4 above, we knew the algorithm worked.</p>

    <p>While this example accomplishes our needs for debugging a DSP algorithm,
the same approach can (in general) be applied to <em>many</em> other FPGA
algorithms.
For example, you can find my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/tree/master/bench/cpp">UART protocol validator here</a>, my QSPI flash
<a href="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">validator here</a>, and an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi/tree/master/bench/cpp">SD-Card SPI-based protocol validator here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The easiest way of writing the logic twice with a DSP algorithm is to do
(and plot) the work within <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>.</p>

    <p>The neat thing about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>
is that you can plot various things in an ad-hoc manner.  Data can be
scaled, reshaped and resampled, Fourier transforms may be applied, axes
can be changed, labels adjusted, screen sizes changed, bit widths adjusted,
etc., all very quickly and easily.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As an interesting side note, I once debugged the signal processing internal to
a two-way radio communications channel in a similar fashion to this.  This
approach really works very well.</p>
