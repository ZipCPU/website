    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>’s
can handle simple things well, and they handle simple things fast.
Other things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">PI</a>
(<a href="https://www.angio.net/pi/digits/100000.txt">3.1415926535897932…</a>) are harder to
deal with.  How then shall phase be dealt with within an FPGA, and in what
units?</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1: Radians</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/angular-unit-radians.svg" alt="Radians measure angles counterclockwise from right or East, starting at zero and going to 2pi" width="288" /></td></tr></table>
<p>The mathematicians will define phase in units of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">Radians</a>, with values ranging
between zero and 2PI, as shown in Fig 1.  Further, the units are periodic, so
anything outside
of the range between zero and 2PI may be brought into the range by adding
as many 2PI values as necessary.</p>

<table style="float: left"><caption>Fig 2: Degrees</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/angular-unit-degrees.svg" alt="Degrees measure angles counterclockwise from right or East, starting at zero and going to 360" width="288" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Others will define phase as a number between 0 and
360 degrees, as shown in Fig 2.</p>

<p>Both refer to the same thing–the measure of of the angle between pointing to
the right and any other direction, measured in the counter clockwise direction.
You can also use one of these measures to measure the amount of time, within
a periodic waveform, from the beginning of the period to anywhere within the
period.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">Radians</a>
may be the natural units of phase (angles), they are not the first choice of
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
designer.  Why not?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>’s
need to have a known number of bits to represent something.  If you
allocate enough bits to handle 0 to 8 (containing 0 to 2PI, or 6.28..),
you’ll have a difficult time dealing with 16PI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">Radians</a> have
roll over problems.  While both PI and 3PI/2 are valid angles
between 0 and 2PI, their sum is outside of the
range between 0 and 2PI.  Before you can use this out-of-range value,
and before you can add any more phase increments to it, the number must be
normalized by subtracting 2PI from it to get it back into the range of
0 to 2PI.</p>

    <p>This will cost you a clock, and slow any algorithm you are building down by
a factor of two.</p>

    <p>It will also only work if your wander into the range between 2PI and
4PI, but not between 50PI and 52PI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>’s
 can’t really handle numbers between 0 and 1.</p>

    <p>This problem is so common and the solution so simple and so well known that
aspiring
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">DSP</a>
engineers might just multiply the values from 0 to PI by 2^N and consider
that the solution without ever thinking twice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While these might seem like viable solutions, a better approach
to dealing with angles exists.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-unit-for-angles">A Better Unit for Angles</h2>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3: FPGA Angles</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/angular-unit-fpga.svg" alt="FPGA angular units measure angles counterclockwise from right or East, starting at zero and going to 2^N" width="288" /></td></tr></table>
<p>A simpler and better angular unit choice, shown in Fig 3, is simply to map
the range from 0 to 2PI onto the integer interval from <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^N</code>.  This can
then be represented with an N-bit number.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>fpga_val = floor( theta * 2^N / (2PI) + 0.5)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>What’s neat about this approach to angles within an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
is that rollover is handled naturally, with no other logic required.</p>

<p>Consider how one might add PI to 3PI/2.  We’ll use N=8, and so we’ll be
representing angles with to within a degree or two.  Hence,
our expression becomes 8’h80 plus 8’hc0.  If you add these two values together,
and throw out any rollover, you get the value 8’h40.</p>

<p>Notice from this example how we didn’t need to waste a clock to bring our
results back within limits.  Neither were we restricted to only integer
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">Radians</a>
values, even though we did our calculation with integers.</p>

<p>Even better,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>’s
are often optimized for integer arithmetic.  Hence,
angular adjustments made in this fashion become easy and simple.</p>

<h2 id="generating-sine-or-cosine">Generating Sine or Cosine</h2>

<p>Depending upon your needs, you can easily convert this angle to a sine and
cosine value.</p>

<p>For example, you could use the top bit as your sine wave value, and get a
square wave out with no more work.  This was the approach used by the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbfmtx">wishbone
controlled FM transmitter hack</a> in order
to transmit an FM signal from an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>.</p>

<p>You could also use the top several bits as an <a href="/dsp/2017/07/11/simplest-sinewave-generator.html">index into a
table</a>,
and so build a direct digital synthesizer.  Your table doesn’t need to contain
a full copy of a sine wave, it might even contain only a
<a href="/dsp/2017/08/26/quarterwave.html">quarter wave</a> and still
be quite successful.</p>

<p>Even slicker is to use your angle as an input to a <a href="/dsp/2017/08/30/cordic.html">CORDIC
algorithm</a>.  In that
case, you can use this angle as an input to generate a sine wave or cosine
wave.  You can also use the <a href="/dsp/2017/08/30/cordic.html">CORDIC
algorithm</a>
to multiply by sine and cosine (at the same time), or to
<a href="/dsp/2017/09/01/topolar.html">calculate arc-tangents</a>.
If you like this idea, you ought to know that the <a href="/dsp/2017/08/30/cordic.html">CORDIC
algorithm</a> can be pipelined so
as to operate at one input/output per clock–with no throughput loss, such as
you would’ve had were you using either
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">Radians</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)">degrees</a> as your angular units.</p>

<p>Gosh, the <a href="http://www.andraka.com/files/crdcsrvy.pdf">CORDIC algorithm</a> is just
<em>so</em> useful, we might need to
<a href="/dsp/2017/08/30/cordic.html">write a post on it by itself</a>.</p>

<p>Coming back to our topic, though, <em>all</em> of these approaches to generating sine
waves work nicely … but only if you use the right angular units.</p>
