    <p>One of the most common things any DSP implementation needs to do is
interpolation.  Here, let’s just discuss how to handle nearest neighbour
interpolation.</p>

<p>Among all interpolants, the nearest neighbour interpolator is probably the
worst one you could use with respect to signal quality.  Better interpolators
exist: linear interpolation, quadratic interpolation, etc.  These all require
multiplies, careful attention to detail to avoid overflow, and more.  If you
want to build an interpolator, though, the nearest neighbour interpolator
is the place to start learning.</p>

<p>As you read below, you’ll see why a nearest neighbour interpolator is the
simplest interpolator you could build.</p>

<h2 id="problem-setup">Problem Setup</h2>

<p>The first step to interpolation is to set up the problem properly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your input is an <strong>i_data</strong> bus which will be valid any time <strong>i_stb</strong>
is true.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your output is an <strong>o_data</strong> bus, together with an <strong>o_stb</strong> qualifier.
Whenever the <strong>o_stb</strong> line is true, the <strong>o_data</strong> bus will have valid
data within it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="generating-the-output-clock">Generating the Output Clock</h2>

<p>The next step is to handle your clock.  Here, you have two options.  You
can generate a <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/generating-timing.html">fractional
clock</a> based upon
your system clock, or you could do the same based upon the input sampling clock.
The two options will look nearly identical.</p>

<p>Here’s how you would generate your output timing based upon the system clock:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">o_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">fractional_system_clock_divider</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this case, the <strong>fractional_system_clock_divider</strong> is given by
two raised to the clock width, times the output clock rate you would like,
divided by the system clock rate.  The units of the two clock rates don’t
matter, just as long as they are consistent.</p>

<p>And here’s how you would generate the output clock based upon the incoming
sample clock:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_stb</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">o_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">fractional_sample_clock_divider</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span>
		<span class="n">o_stb</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this case, the clock is set nearly identically, but the fractional divider
is instead calculated with respect to the input clock rate, rather than the
output clock rate.</p>

<h2 id="handling-the-data-signals">Handling the Data Signals</h2>

<p>On every input clock, we create a copy of the data.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_stb</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">neighbour</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>On every output clock, we copy that data to the output.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_stb</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">neighbour</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Might the incoming data change multiple times between the incoming sample and
the outgoing sample?  Yes.  Won’t this cause a problem?  Yes it will.  The
problem this would create is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing">aliasing</a>.</p>

<p>You can solve the aliasing problem by filtering your input signal before
it comes into the resampler.</p>

<h2 id="does-anyone-really-use-this">Does anyone really use this?</h2>

<p>Nearest neighbour interpolators have a lot of problems.  It’s not hard to
find or see these problems.  If they are so poor, are they ever used?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Have I ever used one?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I used a nearest neighbour interpolator once when I needed to resample a signal
with an 1024/1023 resampler.  To make it work, though, I first insisted that the
signal was oversampled (8x in my case) at the output of the anti-aliasing
filter.  When I later compared the result with a linear interpolator,
the nearest neighbour interpolator worked “good enough” for my application, and
so I dropped the linear interpolator alternative for this simpler one.</p>

<p>The other place you may see this getting used is in a waveform transmitter
when the input clock is just slower than the output clock.  In this case,
if a new sample isn’t presented to the transmitter by the next sample clock,
the last sample can be repeated.  You can see this approach used in both the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpwmaudio/blob/master/rtl/wbpwmaudio.v">PWM audio</a>,
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbfmtx/blob/master/rtl/wbfmtxhack.v">FM transmitter
(hack)</a>
controllers I’ve put together.</p>

<h2 id="for-further-study">For Further Study</h2>

<p>If you are interested in knowing more about interpolation, you can find a
document describing how to do arbitrary digital interpolation
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/raw/master/tutorial.pdf">here</a>.
In this blog, we’ll focus not on the generics of interpolation, but rather on
how to build an interpolator.</p>
