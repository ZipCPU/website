        <H1>Projects List</H1>

<div class="home">
Most of my time these days is spent working on commercial projects.  Some of
these are listed at <A HREF="https://www.arasan.com">arasan.com</A>.</P>

<div class="home">
As of May, 2023, I'm also in the middle of generating the
<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/eth10g">IP for a 10Gb Ethernet switch</A>.
The project is far from complete, but when finished it should also include
<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">HDMI</A>
and <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbsata">SATA</A> controllers in addition
to the <A HREF="/blog/2023/04/08/vpktfifo.html">virtual
packet FIFOs I've written about</A>.
(The <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbsata">SATA</A> controller is
currently a work in progress, as is the GTX transceiver controller for the
10Gb Ethernet portion.) This project may also be a nice place to showcase my
<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">universal I2C controller</A>--which
has already started its service driving an
<A HREF="https://www.amazon.com/Teyleten-Robot-Display-SSD1306-Raspberry/dp/B08ZY4YBHL/">OLED display</A> and reading from a temperature sensor.
If this is a project you are interested in, you can track my progress
on the <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/eth10g/blob/master/doc/eth10g-blocks.png">Ethernet
portion here</A>, and on the
<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/eth10g/blob/master/doc/eth10g-busblocks.png">project in general here</A>.
As of this writing, we're only working on bringing up the first (draft)
circuit board, so there's a lot more to come.  Feel free to write me if you
have further inquiries regarding this board.</P>

<div class="home">
I've also built a number of Open Source projects that may be of value to you:
<UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">The ZipCPU</A></B>
	<P>A fully functional, fully pipelined, 32-bit CPU designed for
	resource constrained FPGA environments.  Includes GCC, Binutils,
	and Newlib support.  Although designed to be
	powerful enough to run Linux, a Linux port has not yet been written.
	Many of the projects that follow use this CPU.</P>
	<P>Why doesn't the <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</A>
	support Linux?  For two primary reasons.  1) It's still missing a
	functional MMU, and 2) it's worked so well on my current projects
	that Linux hasn't been my priority.
	<P>If you are interested in reading more about the
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</A>, consider
	reading
	"<A HREF="/zipcpu/2018/01/01/zipcpu-isa.html">A Quick
	Introduction to the ZipCPU's Instruction Set</A>",
	"<A HREF="/zipcpu/2018/01/31/cpu-build.html">Instructions for
	building the GCC-based toolchain</A>", or
	"<A HREF="/zipcpu/2023/05/29/zipcpu-3p0.html">Introducing
	the ZipCPU v3.0</A>".</P>


<LI><A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> systems: The following are fully
	built, full featured systems for which the
	<A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> has been placed inside:
  <UL>
  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</A></B>

	<P>This was one of my very first
	<A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> projects.  It was a successful
	demonstration of how the
	<A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> could be made to fit on on even
	the smallest of FPGA's.  Since the last build, the
	<A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> has evolved significantly, and
	I haven't used the Spartan 6 to revisit the project.  The RTL,
	therefore, represents the state of the CPU when this project was last
	built and known to work on hardware.
	<P>This same is true for the other projects that follow.  The RTL
	in the master branch is the RTL that was used in the last hardware
	test or demonstration, and may not have been updated since even though
	the <A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> and/or other components have
	gone through many updates.

</P>
  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/arrowzip">ArrowZip</A></B>

	<P>The <A HREF="/blog/2017/12/16/max1k.html">MAX-1000
	was a very inexpensive FPGA board</A> sold by both Arrow and Trenz.
	(I'm not sure you can buy it anymore ...)  This project places a
	<A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> on this
	board.  It's also a demonstration of my (formally verified)
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/arrowzip/blob/master/rtl/arrowzip/wbsdram.v">Wishbone
	SDRAM</A> controller.</P>

  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty</A></B>

	<P>Demonstrates both the
	<A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> and
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</A> on a
	Digilent Arty A7 board.</P>

  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic">ZBasic</A></B>

	<P>This is a bare bones, minimal <A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> system.  If you wish to build
	a <A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> system and don't know where to start, this may be just
	the place.  See <A HREF="/zipcpu/2018/02/12/zbasic-intro.html">this post</A> for a discussion on how to get started with ZBasic.</A>
	<P>This was also (at one time) the project where I tested out new
	<A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>
	and <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA"</A>
	features.  However, with the
	<A HREF="/zipcpu/2023/05/29/zipcpu-3p0.html">latest
	release</A> of the
	<A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>, I may not
	need this test ground anymore.</P>
</P>

  <LI>My original <A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> project was built for the Basys3

	<P>Sorry, this project doesn't have a cool name.  It was my first
	FPGA project, and one from before I was working on open source projects.
	One unique feature of this one is that I drive the VGA port from the
	flash, and so this project can be used to display arbitrary presentation
	types of images (i.e. static images) on a VGA screen.
	The <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA simulator</A>
	from this project has since been
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">posted on github</A> as
	well.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip">VideoZIP</A> is
        another system I'm working on.  This one, though, is built
	entirely via the
	<B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</A></B>
	program.  The goal was (originally) to both receive HDMI signals, and
	transmit HDMI signals.  As an unfunded project, it's not complete.
	However, I have managed to get the HDMI receive function working
	(just not the save to memory part), and it seems to be working well.

	Curiously, this <em>unfinished</em> project has formed the basis for
	many of my commercial projects.  This is just a really capable board.

	<P>There is also a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/tree/enet/">
	branch offering RGMII based GbE support</A> which has yet to be
	merged into the project as a whole.  GbE support does work, the
	Tri-mode options haven't been well tested yet.
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">ICOZip</A>, unlike the
	previous systems is a <A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> based
	system designed for the iCE40 on the
	<A HREF="https://www.icoboard.org">ICO board</A>.  It can be
	built using the entirely open source yosys based tool-chain.
        This is another design built using
	<B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</A></B>.
	Further, like the
  	<B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</A></B> design
	listed above, this is also a minimum logic design.
  </UL></P>
<LI>Digital Signal Processing (DSP) cores
	<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic">CORDIC</A>
	<P>This core generator will create a one of several sine-wave generators
	in Verilog.  These include a 1)
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/sintable.v">table based sinewave generator</A>,
	2) a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/quarterwav.v">quarter-wave table based sinewave generator</A>,
	3) a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/cordic.v">CORDIC based sin/cosine generator</A>,
	and 4) a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/quadtbl.v">quadratically interpolated sinewave generator</A>.
	The core generator can also generate a
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/topolar.v">CORDIC based arctangent</A>.
	By using the core-gen approach, bit widths, precisions, and more are all
	adjustable/configurable.
	<P>With only a <A HREF="/dsp/2017/12/09/nco.html">touch more logic</A>, any of these cores can be made into
	a <A HREF="/dsp/2017/12/09/nco.html">Numerically
	Controlled Oscillator</A>
	</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters">DSP Filters</A>
	<P>We've discussed many digital filters on the blog.  This repository
	holds the filters I've presented.
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation">Interpolation</A>
	<P>Years ago, I built a
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/raw/master/tutorial.pdf">tutorial slide deck</A>
	presenting a piecewise polynomial approach to interpolation.  That
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/raw/master/tutorial.pdf">tutorial</A>
	is housed in this repository.  Since then, I've added several
	Verilog interpolation implementations as well:
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/tree/rtl/master/nearest-neighbor">nearest neighbor</A>,
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/tree/rtl/master/lininterp">linear</A>, and
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/tree/rtl/master/quadratic">quadratic</A>.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">Double Clock FFT</A>
	<P>This is an open source, pipelined FFT/IFFT generator.  The
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/sw/fftgen.cpp">core generator software</A>
	will create Verilog code for a fairly generic pipelined FFT.  It
	is very configurable, allowing the user to choose:
	<UL>
	<LI>The FFT size, and whether a forward or inverse transform is desired
	<LI>Input, output, and internal bit widths
	<LI>The bit widths of the twiddle factors
	<LI>The number of hardware multiplies used.  If there aren't enough
		hardware multiplies available, the FFT will substitute a
		firmware multiplication algorithm.
	</UL>
	You can read about <A HREF="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">this core and what it took to verify it here</A>.
	My goal remains to eventually offer a real (as opposed to complex)
	FFT capability as well, but I'm still one stage (and a lot of testing)
	away from reaching that goal.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/fftdemo">FFT Demo</A>
	<P>This project connects a simulated PModMIC3 to a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">simulated VGA</A>
	output to create a scrolling spectral raster display.
	An upgrade to the version on github uses DDR3 SDRAM (instead of large
	amounts of block RAM), and an HDMI output.
	<P>A further upgrade uses the <A HREF="/dsp/freq-teaser.html">high resolution frequency filters</A>.  For another comparison of both with and without
	the high resolution filter, see <A HREF="/img/tweets/fq-swepttone.png">this image</a>.
	</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dpll">PLLs</A>
	<P>I have published the code for two PLLs.  The one I call a
	<A HREF="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">logic PLL</A>
	may be found in <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dpll">this
	repository</A>.  The
	<A HREF="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">logic PLL</A>
	has the unique feature that it can receive and update within a single
	clock.  The other PLL can be found in the <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/gpsclock.v">GPS schooled clock code</A>.
	I have also designed a
	<A HREF="/dsp/dpll-teaser.html">couple of
	other PLL approaches</A> that will take
	more than a single clock.  Those should have *much* better performance,
	but I have yet to port those PLL designs to an FPGA and test them.</P>
	</UL>
<LI>Peripherals which may be used by the <A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>
	<P>Computer systems don't make much sense these days without
	peripherals, and the
	<A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>
	is no different.  The following is a truncated list of peripherals that
	have been used with the
	<A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>.</P>
  <UL>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART controller</A>
	<P>Contains both basic, and fully featured, serial port controllers</P>
	<P>Two features make this controller particularly valuable.  The first
	is the four basic UART testing designs in the
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/tree/master/bench/verilog">bench/verilog</A>
	directory.  When starting with any new design, before I know how the
	board designer labeled the UART wires, I use these basic designs
	to test them.  Once tested, I can usually move quickly to a much larger
	and more complex design with a
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">debugging bus</A>
	within it.  The second valuable feature is the Verilator
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/bench/cpp/uartsim.cpp">UART simulator</A>,
	which forwards a simulated designs UART ports to a TCP/IP network
	channel.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">Wishbone based scope</A>

	<P>This plus the <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">UART
	to wishbone bus converter</A> I have might easily be
	considered the basics of any project I work on.  Using this
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</A>,
	I have debugged many, many interfaces--some listed here.  I would
	recommend it for anyone interested in incorporating an internal logic
	analyzer (scope) into one of their projects.</P>
	<P>There is an <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/axilscope.v">AXI-lite version of the scope</A> in the repository as well.
  <LI><A HREF="http://github.com/ZipCPU/qspiflash">QSPI Flash controller</A>

	<P>A <A HREF="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">"universal" QSPI based flash controller</A>, having <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/qspiflash/blob/master/rtl/dualflexpress.v">DSPI</A> and <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/blob/master/rtl/spixpress.v">SPI</A>
	options in the same repository.  I'm now using <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/qspiflash/blob/master/rtl/qflexpress.v">this controller</A> on
	almost all of my projects.
	<P>All of these controllers can execute software in place (XIP).

  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">I2C Controller</A>

	<P>This I2C controller repository began with two I2C controllers, a
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c/blob/master/rtl/wbi2cslave.v">slave</A>
	and a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c/blob/master/rtl/wbi2cmaster.v">master</A>,
	each wishbone controlled.  Those two demonstrated themselves
	via the ability to read and write EDID display information as part of
	an HDMI project.</P>
	<P>Since writing the two of those, I've since come back to the project
	and added a <A HREF="/blog/2021/11/15/ultimate-i2c.thml">Universal I2C controller.</A>
	This controller was originally designed to handle unattended telemetry
	collection in a SONAR system.  It's since been expanded to periodically
	collect temperature in an unattended fashion, or to drive OLED displays.
	It's also capable enough that I may even use it to implement
	an EDDC/CI capability in a display channel in addition to its original
	EDID purpose.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpwmaudio">PWM Audio Controller</A>
	<P>We <A HREF="/dsp/2017/09/04/pwm-reinvention.html">discussed this controller</A>
	on <A HREF="https://zipcpu.com/">the blog</A>, and even
	<A HREF="/dsp/2017/09/16/pwm-demo.html">demonstrated
	it as well</A>.
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/gpsclock.v">GPS schooled clock</A>
	<P>This project takes, as input, the PPS signal from a
	<A HREF="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-gps-gps-receiver">PMod GPS</A>
	and locks an internal counter to the signal.  Using this core, you can
	record the time events to a precision of less than a fraction of a
	microsecond.
	</P>
	<P>This project is currently part of my
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty project</A>, but
	I've applied it to other projects of mine as well.  Currently, using
	the crystal oscillator on the
	<A HREF="https://store.digilentinc.com/arty-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists">Arty</A>
	and the <A HREF="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-gps-gps-receiver">PMod GPS</A> from
	<A HREF="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</A>,
	it can timestamp events within the design to within about 500ns or so
	of absolute time.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/rtcclock">RTC Clock</A>

	<P>This is a very simple, almost beginner, exercise to create a
	clock in hours, minutes and seconds.  It also includes a minutes and
	seconds count-down timer, a stop watch, and alarm capability.
	</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDSPI SD-card controller</A>

	<P>In order to use the SD Card on the XuLA board, I needed a SPI
	based SD-Card controller.  While I intend to upgrade this to SDIO in
	the future, the SPI based controller is still valuable for some
	designs.</P>
	<P>Since the original usage, I've been able to demonstrate reading and
	writing files files from/to the SD Card.  Even better, I can boot
	the <A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>
	off of a program stored on the SD card.  Lord willing, this could make
	a nice post.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbfmtx">FM transmitter hack</A>

	<P>Just to prove FPGA's are in no ways inferior to
	<A HREF="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/raspberry-pi-fm-transmitter/">Raspberry
	PI's</A>, this peripheral can be used to turn your GPIO pins into an
	ad-hoc FM transmitter.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpmic">WBPMIC</A>

	<P>A very simple controller designed to read from <A HREF="http://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</A>'s
	<A HREF="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-mic3-mems-microphone-with-adjustable-gain/">MEMs microphone PMod</A>.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/wboled.v">WB
	Oled</A>, a controller for the
	<A HREF="http://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</A>
	<A HREF="http://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-oledrgb-96-x-64-rgb-oled-display-with-16-bit-color-resolution/">PMod OLEDrgb</A> display

	<P>A special feature of this design is the GTKmm based
	simulation component, allowing you to visually "see" what the controller
	would be placing on the screen.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbicapetwo">ICAPE Interface</A>

	<P>Xilinx's internal configuration access port provides some very
	useful features.  Getting it running initially, though, was a touch

  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA Simulator</A>

	<P>While not technically a "peripheral that may be used by the ZipCPU",
	the VGA simulator is a very important part of any graphical development.
	A not-yet-released version simulates HDMI as well.  Using the simulator,
	you will be able to run your code within Verilator and visualize the
	output within a GTK window on your computer screen--with no hardware
	required beyond your desktop machine.

I've also been known to offer a two day <u>Introduction to Formal
Methods</u> course to teach Verilog and VHDL developers how to use
<A HREF="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SymbiYosys</A>
in a "formal first" strategy.

<P><UL>
  	<P>Traditionally, the price of
	<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal
	methods</A> has limited their use to small teams of verification
	engineers within large corporations.  Today,
	<A HREF="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SymbiYosys</A>
	lowers the price of
	<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal
	verification</A> tools to the point where every RTL developer
	can use them.

	<P>The course teaches
	<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal
	verification</A>
	from the basics through
	bounded model checking and induction steps.  Specific topics discussed
	include dissimilar clocking, abstraction, invariants, arbitrary
	values, and more.  Examples will be drawn from counters, SPI
	interactions, SDRAM controllers, cache implementations,
	peripheral bus interaction, and more.

	<P>This course can be booked for corporate training on-site.
	Please contact me for details.
