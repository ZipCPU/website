<A HREF="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist
Technology, LLC</A>, is offering a two day <u>Introduction to Formal
Methods</u> course to teach Verilog and VHDL developers how to use
<A HREF="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SymbiYosys</A>
in a "formal first" strategy.

<P><UL>
  	<P>Traditionally, the price of
	<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal
	methods</A> has limited their use to small teams of verification
	engineers within large corporations.  Today,
	<A HREF="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SymbiYosys</A>
	lowers the price of
	<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal
	verification</A> tools to the point where every RTL developer
	can use them.

	<P>The course teaches
	<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal
	verification</A>
	from the basics through
	bounded model checking and induction steps.  Specific topics discussed
	include dissimilar clocking, abstraction, invariants, arbitrary
	values, and more.  Examples will be drawn from counters, SPI
	interactions, SDRAM controllers, cache implementations,
	peripheral bus interaction, and more.

	<P>This course can be booked for corporate training on-site.
	Please contact me for details.

<div class="home">
<A HREF="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist
Technology, LLC</A>, has also built a number of Open Source projects
that may be of value to you:
<UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">The ZipCPU</A></B>
	<P>A fully functional, fully pipelined, 32-bit CPU designed for
	resource constrained FPGA environments.  Although designed to be
	powerful enough to run Linux, a Linux port has not yet been written.
	Many of the projects that follow use this CPU.</P>
	<P>If you are interested, consider reading
	"<A HREF="/zipcpu/2018/01/01/zipcpu-isa.html">A Quick
	Introduction to the ZipCPU's Instruction Set</A>", or
	"<A HREF="/zipcpu/2018/01/31/cpu-build.html">Instructions for
	building the GCC-based toolchain</A>".</P>

	<P>Recent developments on the <A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>
	have included the development of both a
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/dev/rtl/core/dcache.v">data cache</A> and an
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">MMU</A>.
	While the <A HREF="http://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/dev/rtl/core/dcache.v">data cache</A>
	has been (optionally) integrated, it depends upon an
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/dev/rtl/core/iscachable.v">external file</A>
	to tell it what address regions are cachable and which ones are not.
	An upgraded version of <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</A> now provides this information.
	The <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">MMU</A> has yet to be integrated.</P>


<LI><A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> systems: The following are fully built, full featured systems for
	which the <A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> has been placed inside
  <UL>
  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</A></B>

	<P>This may be one of the most fully documented systems that uses the
	<A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>.  It's also a demonstration of how the <A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> can be made to fit
	on even the smallest of FPGA's.</P>
  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/arrowzip">ArrowZip</A></B>

	<P>The <A HREF="blog/2017/12/16/max1k.html">MAX-1000 is a very
	inexpensive FPGA board</A> sold by both Arrow and Trenz.  This project
	places a <A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> on this board.  It's
	also a demonstration of my (formally verified) <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/arrowzip/blob/master/rtl/arrowzip/wbsdram.v">Wishbone SDRAM</A>
	controller.</P>

  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty</A></B>

	<P>This may be one of the most fully documented systems that uses the
	<A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>.  It's also a demonstration of how the <A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> can be made to fit
	on even the smallest of FPGA's.</P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><P>This project is in the middle of a
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/tree/autoarty">massive
	rewrite</A> to make it compatible with
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</A>.
	Part of the purpose of this rewrite is to handle the flash	
	controller found on the newer Arty A7 boards.
	Significant progress has been made, and the new design builds, however
	not all of the component interfaces work yet.</A>
	<P>While the original version of OpenArty required a PModOLEDrgb,
	a PModUSBUART, a PModSD(card), and a PModGPS, one of the goals of this
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/tree/autoarty">newer version of OpenArty</A>
	is not to be more (re)configurable via <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</A> so that it doesn't require these pieces of hardware,
	and yet may still use other pieces.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">XuLA2-LX25SoC</A></B>

	<P>While fully functional, this design isn't well documented.  It's
	unique because the debug access point to the device is run from the
	JTAG port, rather than a UART.  The system runs on on both the
	XuLA2-LX25 as well as the XuLA2-LX9.  Let me know if you would like to
	try this, and I'll help you get started.</P>

	<P>This design is also unique due to the presence of a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc/blob/master/rtl/wbsdram.v">formally
	verified SDRAM controller</A> within it.
  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic">ZBasic</A></B>

	<P>This is a bare bones, minimal <A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> system.  If you wish to build
	a <A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> system and don't know where to start, this may be just
	the place.  See <A HREF="/zipcpu/2018/02/12/zbasic-intro.html">this post</A> for a discussion on how to get started with ZBasic.</A>
	<P>This is also the project where I test out new <A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">
	and <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA"</A>
	features, so you may sometimes see features in this project not yet
	ported to others.</P>

  <LI>My original <A HREF="about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> project was built for the Basys3

	<P>Sorry, this project doesn't have a cool name.  It was my first
	FPGA project, and one from before I was working on open source projects.
	One unique feature of this one is that I drive the VGA port from the
	flash, and so this project can be used to display arbitrary presentation
	types of images (i.e. static images) on a VGA screen.
	The <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA simulator</A>
	from this project has since been
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">posted on github</A> as
	well.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip">VideoZIP</A> is
        another system I'm working on.  This one, though, is built
	entirely via the
	<B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</A></B>
	program.  The goal is to both receive HDMI signals, and transmit
	HDMI signals.  As an unfunded project, it's not complete.  However,
	I have managed to get the HDMI receive function working (just not
	the save to memory part), and it seems to be working well.

	<P>There is also a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/tree/enet/">
	branch offering RGMII based GbE support</A> which has yet to be
	merged into the project as a whole.  GbE support does work, the
	Tri-mode options haven't been well tested yet.
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">ICOZip</A>, unlike the
	previous systems is a <A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A> based
	system designed for the iCE40 on the
	<A HREF="https://www.icoboard.org">ICO board</A>.  It can be
	built using the entirely open source yosys based tool-chain.
        This is another design built using
	<B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</A></B>.
	Further, like the
  	<B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</A></B> design
	listed above, this is also a minimum logic design.
  </UL></P>
<LI>Digital Signal Processing (DSP) cores
	<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic">CORDIC</A>
	<P>This core generator will create a one of several sine-wave generators
	in Verilog.  These include a 1)
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/sintable.v">table based sinewave generator</A>,
	2) a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/quarterwav.v">quarter-wave table based sinewave generator</A>,
	3) a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/cordic.v">CORDIC based sin/cosine generator</A>,
	and 4) a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/quadtbl.v">quadratically interpolated sinewave generator</A>.
	The core generator can also generate a
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/topolar.v">CORDIC based arctangent</A>.
	By using the core-gen approach, bit widths, precisions, and more are all
	adjustable/configurable.
	<P>With only a <A HREF="/dsp/2017/12/09/nco.html">touch more logic</A>, any of these cores can be made into
	a <A HREF="/dsp/2017/12/09/nco.html">Numerically
	Controlled Oscillator</A>
	</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dspfilters">DSP Filters</A>
	<P>We've discussed many digital filters on the blog.  This repository
	holds the filters I've presented.
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation">Interpolation</A>
	<P>Years ago, I built a
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/raw/master/tutorial.pdf">tutorial slide deck</A>
	presenting a piecewise polynomial approach to interpolation.  That
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/raw/master/tutorial.pdf">tutorial</A>
	is housed in this repository.  Since then, I've added several
	Verilog interpolation implementations as well:
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/tree/rtl/master/nearest-neighbor">nearest neighbor</A>,
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/tree/rtl/master/lininterp">linear</A>, and
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/tree/rtl/master/quadratic">quadratic</A>.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft">Double Clock FFT</A>
	<P>This is an open source, pipelined FFT/IFFT generator.  The
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dblclockfft/blob/master/sw/fftgen.cpp">core generator software</A>
	will create Verilog code for a fairly generic pipelined FFT.  It
	is very configurable, allowing the user to choose:
	<UL>
	<LI>The FFT size, and whether a forward or inverse transform is desired
	<LI>Input, output, and internal bit widths
	<LI>The bit widths of the twiddle factors
	<LI>The number of hardware multiplies used.  If there aren't enough
		hardware multiplies available, the FFT will substitute a
		firmware multiplication algorithm.
	</UL>
	You can read about <A HREF="blog/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">this core and what it took to verify it here</A>.
	My goal remains to eventually offer a real (as opposed to complex)
	FFT capability as well, but I'm still one stage (and a lot of testing)
	away from reaching that goal.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/fftdemo">FFT Demo</A>
	<P>This project connects a simulated PModMIC3 to a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">simulated VGA</A>
	output to create a scrolling spectral raster display.
	An upgrade to the version on github uses DDR3 SDRAM (instead of large
	amounts of block RAM), and an HDMI output.
	<P>A further upgrade uses the <A HREF="dsp/freq-teaser.html">high resolution frequency filters</A>.  For another comparison of both with and without
	the high resolution filter, see <A HREF="img/tweets/fq-swepttone.png">this image</a>.
	</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dpll">PLLs</A>
	<P>I have published the code for two PLLs.  The one I call a
	<A HREF="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">logic PLL</A>
	may be found in <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dpll">this
	repository</A>.  The
	<A HREF="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">logic PLL</A>
	has the unique feature that it can receive and update within a single
	clock.  The other PLL can be found in the <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/gpsclock.v">GPS schooled clock code</A>.
	I have also designed a
	<A HREF="/dsp/dpll-teaser.html">couple of
	other PLL approaches</A> that will take
	more than a single clock.  Those should have *much* better performance,
	but I have yet to port those PLL designs to an FPGA and test them.</P>
	</UL>
<LI>Peripherals which may be used by the <A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>
	<P>Computer systems don't make much sense these days without
	peripherals, and the
	<A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>
	is no different.  The following is a truncated list of peripherals that
	have been used with the
	<A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</A>.</P>
  <UL>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART controller</A>
	<P>Contains both basic, and fully featured, serial port controllers</P>
	<P>Two features make this controller particularly valuable.  The first
	is the four basic UART testing designs in the
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/tree/master/bench/verilog">bench/verilog</A>
	directory.  When starting with any new design, before I know how the
	board designer labeled the UART wires, I use these basic designs
	to test them.  Once tested, I can usually move quickly to a much larger
	and more complex design with a
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">debugging bus</A>
	within it.  The second valuable feature is the Verilator
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/bench/cpp/uartsim.cpp">UART simulator</A>,
	which forwards a simulated designs UART ports to a TCP/IP network
	channel.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">Wishbone based scope</A>

	<P>This plus the <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">UART
	to wishbone bus converter</A> I have might easily be
	considered the basics of any project I work on.  Using this
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</A>,
	I have debugged many, many interfaces--some listed here.  I would
	recommend it for anyone interested in incorporating an internal logic
	analyzer (scope) into one of their projects.</P>
	<P>There is an <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/axilscope.v">AXI-lite version of the scope</A> in the repository as well.
  <LI><A HREF="http://github.com/ZipCPU/qspiflash">QSPI Flash controller</A>

	<P>A <A HREF="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">"universal" QSPI based flash controller</A>, having <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/qspiflash/blob/master/rtl/dualflexpress.v">DSPI</A> and <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/blob/master/rtl/spixpress.v">SPI</A>
	options in the same repository.  I'm now using <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/qspiflash/blob/master/rtl/qflexpress.v">this controller</A> on
	almost all of my projects.
	<P>All of these controllers can execute software in place (XIP).

  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbhyperram/tree/dev">Hyper-RAM Controller</A>

	<P>This is also a work in progress.  While it currently passes a
	formal verification step, it doesn't do so with the actual IO delays
	involved in using hardware IO pins (yet).  More to come.

  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/autoartyy/rtl/enetpackets.v">Ethernet Packet controller</A>

	<P>A full featured RMII network packet interface, contained within the
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty</A>
	distribution.  Also within that distribution is a demonstration
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/sw/board/simple_ping.c">"ping" program</A> for the <A HREF="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU.</A></P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">I2C Controller</A>

	<P>This I2C controller repository contains both a <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c/blob/master/rtl/wbi2cslave.v">slave</A>
	and <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c/blob/master/rtl/wbi2cmaster.v">master</A>
	I2C controllers, each wishbone controlled.  It has demonstrated itself
	via the ability to read and write EDID display information as part of
	an HDMI project.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpwmaudio">PWM Audio Controller</A>
	<P>We <A HREF="/blog/2017/09/04/pwm-reinvention.html)">discussed this controller</A>
	on <A HREF="https://zipcpu.com/">the blog</A>, and even
	<A HREF="/dsp/2017/09/16/pwm-demo.html">demonstrated
	it as well</A>.
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/gpsclock.v">GPS schooled clock</A>
	<P>This project takes, as input, the PPS signal from a
	<A HREF="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-gps-gps-receiver">PMod GPS</A>
	and locks an internal counter to the signal.  Using this core, you can
	record the time events to a precision of less than a fraction of a
	microsecond.
	</P>
	<P>This project is currently part of my
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty project</A>, but
	I've applied it to other projects of mine as well.  Currently, using
	the crystal oscillator on the
	<A HREF="https://store.digilentinc.com/arty-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists">Arty</A>
	and the <A HREF="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-gps-gps-receiver">PMod GPS</A> from
	<A HREF="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</A>,
	it can timestamp events within the design to within about 500ns or so
	of absolute time.  I have every reason to believe that, were I able
	to actually test the algorithm properly using a proper
	<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oven">OCXO</A>
	and (better yet) an external reference clock, then I would be able
	to measure a much better performance--I just don't have the test
	setup to try this.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/rtcclock">RTC Clock</A>

	<P>This is a very simple, almost beginner, exercise to create a
	clock in hours, minutes and seconds.  It also includes a minutes and
	seconds count-down timer, a stop watch, and alarm capability.
	</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDSPI SD-card controller</A>

	<P>In order to use the SD Card on the XuLA board, I needed a SPI
	based SD-Card controller.  While I intend to upgrade this to SDIO in
	the future, the SPI based controller is still valuable for some
	designs.</P>
	<P>Update: I can now read and write files from/to the SD Card.
	I hope to post soon about how to build a boot loader in ROM to load
	either software or a design from an SD card using this controller.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbfmtx">FM transmitter hack</A>

	<P>Just to prove FPGA's are in no ways inferior to
	<A HREF="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/raspberry-pi-fm-transmitter/">Raspberry
	PI's</A>, this peripheral can be used to turn your GPIO pins into an
	ad-hoc FM transmitter.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpmic">WBPMIC</A>

	<P>A very simple controller designed to read from <A HREF="http://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</A>'s
	<A HREF="store.digilentinc.com/pmod-mic3-mems-microphone-with-adjustable-gain/">MEMs microphone PMod</A>.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/wboled.v">WB
	Oled</A>, a controller for the
	<A HREF="http://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</A>
	<A HREF="http://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-oledrgb-96-x-64-rgb-oled-display-with-16-bit-color-resolution/">PMod OLEDrgb</A> display

	<P>A special feature of this design is the GTKmm based
	simulation component, allowing you to visually "see" what the controller
	would be placing on the screen.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbicapetwo">ICAPE Interface</A>

	<P>Xilinx's internal configuration access port provides some very
	useful features.  Getting it running initially, though, was a touch
	of a challenge.  This project captures what it takes in a Wishbone
	peripheral format.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA Simulator</A>

	<P>While not technically a "peripheral that may be used by the ZipCPU",
	the VGA simulator is a very important part of any graphical development.
	A not-yet-released version simulates HDMI as well.  Using the simulator,
	you will be able to run your code within Verilator and visualize the
	output within a GTK window on your computer screen--with no hardware
	required beyond your desktop machine.

<LI>Projects that are not posted
	<P>I am a businessman after all, and Gisselquist Technology, LLC, is
	in the business of making money.  Hence, the following two projects
	are available for sale to anyone interested.
  <UL>
  <LI>High resolution frequency analyzer and synthesizer
	<P>We'll discuss this more on this forum as time goes by.  For now,
	the information on the
	<A HREF="/dsp/freq-teaser.html">teaser page</A>
	should be sufficient to gather some interest.</P>
  <LI>Universal resampler, sometimes called an Asynchronous Sample Rate Converter (ASRC)
	<P>Given any signal into your FPGA, at up to the speed of the
	controller (100MHz), downsample that signal to any desired rate with
	32-bit fractional precision.  Alternatively, if you want to upsample,
	you can upsample your signal and then use this universal resampler to
	come down to the rate you would like.</P>
	<P>What makes this project unique from other resamplers you might use
	or build is that the aliasing products from the arbitrary resampler
	are attenuated by a -70dB stop band, making this a high quality
	resampler implementation.
  <LI>GPS processor
	<P>The GPS processing approach I have is very unique, and so applies
	to niche applications.  It is not designed for real-time operation,
	but rather for processing raw captured GPS samples at a later time.
	This allows an ultra low power receiver to capture GPS samples, which
	will then be processed later for position and velocity.  Test results
	show a great immunity to both interference and a poor quality
	signals.</P>

into a legally gray area at this time.  I would ask, therefore, that if you
