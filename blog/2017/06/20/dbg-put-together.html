<p>As we’ve done so, we’ve gone through several posts to get here describing all
of the various components.  Here’s a list of those previous posts in this
series, in case you wish to start at the beginning and go through this
development.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Today’s post is about putting all of these components together.  When we are
done, we’ll have a working debug bus that you can use to read and write from
a <a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">wishbone bus</a> within your design.</p>

<p>In this design, we have very few module level requirements.  Our big goal
is little more than that we put all the pieces together, as outlined in 
Fig. 1 above.  Hence we’ll jump right into putting the pieces together.</p>

<h2 id="putting-the-pieces-together">Putting the Pieces Together</h2>

<p>You can find our various pieces so far
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">here</a>.</p>

<p>As we put these components together, we’ll skip for discussion purposes the
register and wire definitions, as well as the module interface definition.
If you’d like to see all of the pieces, including these definitions,
please feel free to examine the final module code 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbbus.v">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbdechex.v">first
component</a> will
take our incoming stream and turn it into 5-bit data words having a binary
representation.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="n">hbdechex</span> <span class="n">dechxi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i_rx_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i_rx_byte</span><span class="p">,</span>
		<span class="n">dec_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">w_reset</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dec_bits</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that it takes a module level input, <strong>i_rx_byte</strong>,
containing the received byte, together with a strobe, <strong>i_rx_stb</strong>, which
will be true for the one clock when <strong>i_rx_byte</strong> is true.  In a similar
fashion, the outputs bits will be placed into <strong>dec_bits</strong>, which will be
valid any time <strong>dec_stb</strong> is true.</p>

<p>One unique feature of this component is the <strong>w_reset</strong> signal that will be
true for one clock, on the clock after ‘T’ was received.  We’ll use this
signal to reset all of our processing components.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbpack.v">next
component</a> will
then pack our 4-bit values into a 32-bit word.  It will also keep track of
word transitions, and note when any new word begins.  Upon the beginning of a
word, or for that matter any unknown character, the interface will push
forward any command currently within its buffer.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="n">hbpack</span>	<span class="n">packxi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">w_reset</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="n">dec_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dec_bits</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">iw_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">iw_word</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You may have noticed by now that I like to differentiate things by
prefix.  The ouputs of this module have the <strong>iw_</strong> prefix, indicating
that they are the incoming words.</p>

<p>Had you tried to jump into this whole process at the beginning, without the
experience of having done all of our work so far, you might’ve thought that
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbexec.v">bus master</a>
component would be the primary component.  The reality is that thus bus master
function wouldn’t be able to function apart from the other components around it.
The reason is that <em>something</em> needs to tell it what addresses to read and
write from the bus.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="n">hbexec</span>	<span class="n">wbexec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">w_reset</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">iw_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">iw_word</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">wb_busy</span><span class="p">,</span>
		<span class="n">ow_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ow_word</span><span class="p">,</span>
		<span class="n">o_wb_cyc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">o_wb_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">o_wb_we</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">o_wb_addr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">o_wb_data</span><span class="p">,</span>
			<span class="n">o_wb_sel</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i_wb_ack</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i_wb_stall</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i_wb_err</span><span class="p">,</span>
			<span class="n">i_wb_data</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here, it takes its inputs from the <strong>iw_word</strong>, initiates a bus command, and
returns its results in the <strong>ow_word</strong>.  Both of these words will be true
on the one clock with their <strong>_stb</strong> line is true.  The actual bus master
wires are prefixed with <strong>o_wb_</strong> if they go from the master to the slave, and
<strong>i_wb_</strong> if they are returning values from the slave.  Further, because these
have the <strong>i_</strong> and <strong>o_</strong> prefixes, you can tell (from my own notation
convention) that these particular values are module level inputs and outputs.</p>

<p>At this point, our interface changes somewhat.  Prior to this part of our
design, subsequent modules were required to be prepared for an input that
could take place at any clock.  The serial port transmitter, however, at the
other end of this stream cannot handle data at <em>any</em> rate given to it.  So,
we’re going to need to slow things down.  We’ll do this with the <strong>_busy</strong>
signal.  Each unit in this return chain will accept a <strong>_stb</strong> word indicating
that it’s next input word is valid and ready, and it will produce a <strong>_stb</strong>
word indicating that it’s output word is valid and ready.  However, to keep
the interface from moving faster than our resulting transmit transport can
handle, we’ll insist that transactions only take place when the <strong>_stb</strong> is
valid <em>and</em> the <strong>_busy</strong> associated with that stage is false.  Hence, once
the <strong>_stb</strong> signal is raised, it must remain so and the <strong>_word</strong> value
must not change until the <strong>_busy</strong> line from the receiving entity has dropped.</p>

<p>This is actually a fairly common protocol, used by busses ranging from
<a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI</a>
to <a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">Wishbone</a> and more.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/addints.v">first
component</a>
to use this new interface approach is the 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/addints.v">addints</a>
module that adds interrupt notifications into our stream.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="n">hbints</span>	<span class="n">addints</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">w_reset</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i_interrupt</span><span class="p">,</span>
		<span class="n">ow_stb</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="n">ow_word</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="n">int_busy</span><span class="p">,</span>
		<span class="n">int_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">int_word</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">idl_busy</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This stage also acts like a one-stage FIFO, giving us a little bit of a buffer
should responses come from the master too fast for us to deal with them.</p>

<p>You can see the <strong>_busy</strong> line coming from the next stage on the third
line, together with the output lines <strong>int_stb</strong> and <strong>int_word</strong>.
The first line contains the <strong>int_busy</strong> line which would’ve gone to the
prior stage, had we had one that accepted it.  We’ll leave it here unconnected
so that we can grab it when we add a FIFO in to this interface later.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbints.v">hbints</a>
module is followed by the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbidle.v">debug
idles</a>
component that adds idle words into the output stream.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="n">hbidle</span>	<span class="n">addidles</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">w_reset</span><span class="p">,</span>
			<span class="n">int_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">int_word</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">idl_busy</span><span class="p">,</span>
			<span class="n">idl_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">idl_word</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hb_busy</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We then <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbdeword.v">unpack
our words</a> back
into the five-bit components that had composed them originally on input.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="n">hbdeword</span> <span class="n">unpackx</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">w_reset</span><span class="p">,</span>
		<span class="n">idl_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">idl_word</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hb_busy</span><span class="p">,</span>
		<span class="n">hb_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hb_bits</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hx_busy</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These 5-bit components then <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbdeword.v">get
converted</a>
into bytes for the transport.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="n">hbgenhex</span> <span class="n">genhex</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hb_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hb_bits</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hx_busy</span><span class="p">,</span>
			<span class="n">hx_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hx_byte</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">nl_busy</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If the transport ever clears and becomes idle, we’ll <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbnewline.v">add a carriage return
linefeed pair</a>
to the interface.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="n">hbnewline</span> <span class="n">addnl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">w_reset</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hx_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hx_byte</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">nl_busy</span><span class="p">,</span>
		<span class="n">o_tx_stb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">o_tx_byte</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i_tx_busy</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That way any line-based stream logic will know to flush its buffer, since any
partial response would’ve now been completed.</p>

<h2 id="future-posts">Future Posts</h2>

<p>Although this concludes the Verilog development of the debug bus we’ve been
working through, the task isn’t over.  If you have a wishbone bus
that you would like to experiment with commanding, feel free to fire this up
and give it a try.  At this point, you have the basics of a capability.</p>

<p>The basics.  In otherwords, while it’s an RTL bus, it doesn’t do anything yet.
We can use it to gain access into a system, but we don’t (yet) have any system
built that we might use this to gain access to.  So, we’re not done yet.</p>

<p>The next items in this series will discuss:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">How to create a simple wishbone interconnect</a></p>

    <p>This will consist of some “interesting” things that we can put together and
test.  We’ll use a block RAM component and a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">Wishbone
scope</a> for this purpose, as well as a
fairly generic set of simple registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating a <a href="/blog/2017/06/26/dbgbus-verilator.html">hand-controlled test
bench</a> to prove
this works</p>

    <p>This will be about building a test bench that we can use to run this whole
package in Verilator.</p>

    <p>Once you get this far, you have an example of something that you can put
in your hardware and try.  But … we’re still not done.  While you may find
the interface somewhat usable, a software controller would make it much
easier to use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating a software bus controller</p>

    <p>That hand-typed interface is going to get old.  We’ll build a software
interface when we get to this point.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Still, this simple debugging bus is now our first design component, and almost
a first design.</p>
