    <p>Using the tools within the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">dbgbus project</a>,
I was able to create the following scope output.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1: Example Output from DBGBUS</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/memscope.png" alt="Example Scope Output" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>What’s keeping you from wanting to use an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">open source</a> capability like this?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Are you trying to figure out how to deal with a flash memory, with an 
uncertain specification that you are struggling to understand?
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/1965-how-to-readwrite-to-p30-parallel-flash-memory-on-digilent-genesys/">[1]</a></p>

    <p>If you use an integrated scope, such as the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone
scope</a> this project uses, you’ll be able
to examine not only whether or not your code is producing the correct output
values, as well as seeing what the response is from the device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or is your problem trying to get an FFT to work?  Are you struggling to “know”
what data is going into the FFT and what data is coming out?
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/3160-xadc-and-the-fft">[2]</a>
<a href="/digilent/2017/05/29/fft-debugging.html">[3]</a></p>

    <p>You could use this approach to grab a copy of the data coming out of the
XADC, as well as data coming out of the FFT, and then see where your problem
is (if any).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are you hoping to connect your Basys3 board to an Arduino, and can’t figure
out why your design isn’t working?  <a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/4233-spi-arduino-to-basys-3">[4]</a></p>

    <p>Wouldn’t it help to see what your logic is doing internally?  That’s the
purpose of this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">debugging bus</a> and
connected <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you want to know what button bouncing looks like?  How long a button
bounces before settling? <a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/3992-something-simple-is-apparently-impossible-incrdecr-number/">[5]</a></p>

    <p>If your button processing code isn’t working, a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a> connected to a 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">debugging bus</a> would show you why a simple
button push isn’t simply incrementing a counter like you might like.
You could <em>see</em> what’s going on for yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Struggling to debug why an FIR filter is or isn’t working? 
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/3492-4-tap-fir-filter">[6]</a>
Do you know if your FPGA code works?  You can use this scope to find out.</p>

    <p>We’ll be discussing within this blog how to go about debugging digital signal
processing using these tools as well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once the software interface to this debugging bus is added into the design,
you’ll be able to do any of the above.</p>
