  </li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve now just about got a fully functional wishbone master controlled from a
serial stream that can now be used as a debugging bus. 
We’ve worked out how to get a serial port up and running,
how to <a href="/blog/2017/06/14/creating-words-from-bytes.html">create words from the serial
stream</a>, and
<a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-wb-master.html">how to control a simple wishbone bus
master</a>
from the command words running through this stream, and then <a href="/blog/2017/06/15/words-back-to-bytes.html">how to send
the response words back down the serial port</a>.  The result is a <em>very simple</em> debugging capability.</p>

<p>While simple, nothing keeps this capability from being very successful within
someone’s design.  This lesson is about adding interrupt notification to the
output stream of our debugging port.</p>

<h2 id="interrupt-requirements">Interrupt Requirements</h2>

<p>For our purposes, we’ll define an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> as the notification of an
event having taken place.  Example interrupts might be that the wishbone scope
has tripped, or that the flash controller has finished erasing or programming
flash.  Either way, some sort of notification has taken place, and you’d like
to be notified of it.</p>

<p>We’ll require this of our interrupt processing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When an interrupt takes place, we’d like to be informed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We don’t want to be informed twice for the same interrupt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We don’t want to need to control the bus interface, but rather the FPGA.
Hence, any internal interrupt state within the bus interface should be self
clearing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interrupt notification should only get inserted into the stream when
the stream is idle.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, whenever the interrupt line is raised, we’ll consider that an
interrupt condition has taken place.  We’ll send an interrupt character (“I”)
across the channel.  No more interrupt notifications will be sent across the
channel until the “I” has been committed to, and the interrupt line has gone
low.</p>

<p>Sound simple enough?</p>

<h2 id="the-interrupt-stream-processor">The interrupt stream processor</h2>

<p>This processor is almost simplicity itself.</p>

<p>We’ll start with the definition of the interrupt command word that we will be
inserting into our stream.  It is a <em>special</em> word, and so it begins with
2’b11.  After that, it is the 2nd special word, so we have a prefix of
5’h11010.  The rest of the interrupt word we set to zero.  That allows us to
extend our protocol later, should we wish to, with 29 bits of information or
zeros to indicate no information.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="cp">`define</span>	<span class="n">INT_PREFIX</span>	<span class="mb">5'b11010</span>
<span class="cp">`define</span>	INT_WORD	<span class="err">{</span> <span class="err">`</span>INT_PREFIX<span class="err">,</span> <span class="err">{(</span>34<span class="err">-</span>5<span class="err">){</span>1<span class="err">'</span>b0<span class="err">}}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I should mention, at this point, a quick lesson in programming practice.  The
first time I built this controller, I didn’t define these values at the top
of the file.  Then, when I needed to change them, I missed changing all of them.
By having `define statements at the top, one change to this definition
will changes all of its uses later.</p>

<p>Our processing will focus around two primary registers: <strong>int_state</strong> and
<strong>pending_interrupt</strong>.  The idea is basically this: when an interrupt takes
place, we’ll go into our interrupt state, and set the interrupt to be pending.
In other words, we are waiting to send the value out the port.  Once the
value has been sent, the pending register will clear, but we’ll stay in our
interrupt state until the interrupt itself clears.</p>

<p>Here you can see that logic below.  First, for the <strong>int_state</strong>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">int_state</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">int_state</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i_interrupt</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">int_state</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">int_state</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">pending_interrupt</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_interrupt</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">int_state</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that this state register is only cleared when the interrupt line goes
low <strong>and</strong> the pending line has gone low, indicating that both we have sent
the interrupt word forward, and that the interrupt has cleared itself.</p>

<p>Then, here’s the same logic but for the <strong>pending_int</strong>.  Note that this
one is cleared whenever the interrupt word is actually sent down stream.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">pending_interrupt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>

			<span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_int_word</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">33</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">29</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="cp">`INT_PREFIX</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">pending_interrupt</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The rest of our logic is mostly stream processing.</p>

<p>For example, we’d like to know when we have a valid word loaded into our
output register, so that the interrupt never slows down our communications
stream, but only inserts itself when we are idle.  If a word is loaded, and
waiting to be sent, then we won’t insert an interrupt into the stream.</p>

<p>We’ll consider a response word to be loaded any time the incoming strobe
is true, and we’ll clear the condition whenever that word gets written our
the output port.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">loaded</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">loaded</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_stb</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">loaded</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">o_int_stb</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_busy</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">loaded</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But when do we have something to write?  Obviously we have something to write
when something is given to us, as in whenever <strong>i_stb</strong> is true.  But we
also want to make certain we have something to write anytime we have a 
<strong>pending_interrupt</strong>.  We’ll clear our output request upon a write, as
long as we don’t have a pending interrupt request.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">o_int_stb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_int_stb</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_stb</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_int_stb</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pending_interrupt</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_int_stb</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">loaded</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">||</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_busy</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">o_int_stb</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The consequence of this logic is that once there is an interrupt waiting to
be inserted into the output stream, <strong>o_int_stb</strong> will remain high until
it is sent.  Likewise, any time there is a word requested, <strong>o_int_stb</strong>
will also remain high.  It’s not going to dip low anytime something moves
in the downstream direction.</p>

<p>Finally, what word shall be sent?  Whenever a request is made, we’ll send
the incoming word.  So that we wait for the request, we’ll wait until the
request is made <strong>and</strong> we don’t have a valid request loaded into our
outgoing register.  If there is no incoming request, then we’ll automatically
load our interrupt word.  This will get ignored, though, unless the
<strong>o_int_stb</strong> line is also high.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h2 id="future-posts">Future Posts</h2>

<p>Adding this one simple capability into our response stream was very easily
done.  We’ll add idles into this stream next to identify our stream as being
used for this purpose.  I think you’ll find, when we add the idles in, that
the idles are just about as easy as the interrupts are.</p>

<p>After we add idle’s, all of the Verilog will be in place.  The next step
will be to create a simple wishbone interconnect, and then the Verilator
test bench necessary to try this out before deploying it on an actual FPGA.</p>

<p>This means we still have the following topics to come:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/06/19/debug-idles.html">Adding idle notifications</a> to let you know you are connected to the right
stream</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Creating a <a href="/blog/2017/06/29/sw-dbg-interface.html">software bus controller</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Indeed, if you wanted to try this controller out, it’s far enough along that
you could probably start working with it today.  Just be aware–it doesn’t
have any FIFO support.  If you try to read from this bus too fast, or write
to it too fast, you may find either your commands or their responses getting
lost.  Perhaps we should add a FIFO to our additional topics list as well, then.</p>

<p>Sound interesting?  Write me if you try this, and let me know how it goes.</p>
