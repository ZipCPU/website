    <p>It’s been a while since I presented the <a href="/blog/2017/05/22/a-vision-for-controlling-fpgas.html">vision for controlling FPGA
logic</a>.
Since that time, we’ve put a lot of work into building an FPGA controller
that we can use for debugging logic running within our FPGA.
<a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">[1]</a>
<a href="/blog/2017/06/14/creating-words-from-bytes.html">[2]</a>

<a href="/blog/2017/06/15/words-back-to-bytes.html">[4]</a></p>

<p>Our goal over all is to provide the student, or any other junior FPGA
designer for that matter, with a tool, similar to what an <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">expert might
use</a>, that he can use to figure out what
is going on within his design.</p>

<p>Today, let’s take a look at what that the software side of communicating
with an FPGA might look like.  In other words, once we connect to our FPGA,
how will we control that FPGA from software?</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-fpga-software-controller">A Simple FPGA Software Controller</h2>

<p>The simplest FPGA control program that I’ve built is the one I call 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sw/host/wbregs.cpp">wbregs</a>.
This program just reads (or writes) a single register within the FPGA.  The
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sw/host/wbregs.cpp">source code</a>
for this program makes it look more complicated than it is though.  That’s
really nothing more than the fact that it’s been lying around long enough to be
<em>improved upon</em> one too many times … but I digress.</p>

<p>Lets trim this program down to its bare minimum details, and see what it
would take to control an FPGA using this sort of controller.</p>

<p>The first step in my idealized world would be to declare a global value
   to hold a pointer to my FPGA’s interface:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="n">FPGA</span> <span class="err">\</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">m_fpga</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then, somewhere within my main program file, I’d want to connect to my FPGA.
If the FPGA talks to the computer via a serial port, I might wish to
say something like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">SERIAL_PORT</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"/dev/ttyUSB0"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">m_fpga</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">FPGA</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SERIAL_PORT</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We may need to come back to the name later, in case we have more than one USB
serial port connector, but for now let’s just move on.</p>

<p>I’d really rather connect to my FPGA from any one of my computers via a
network port, as in:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">FPGASERVER</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"fpgahost.name"</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Could be 192.168.7.1 ...
</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">FPGAPORT</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2853</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Some random number, known to you
//
</span><span class="n">m_fpga</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">FPGA</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">FPGASERVER</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">FPGAPORT</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if that was all it took to connect to an FPGA?</p>

<p>How about reading the a status register from the FPGA?  For example, we
might wish to read from the erase control register of the <a href="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">flash
controller</a> to see if it is still
busy.  In that case, it might be nice to write something as simple as:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">m_fpga</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">readio</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">R_FLASH_EREG</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">FLASH_BUSY</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="p">...</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The same could be said about writing to the erase control register, in order
to command the flash to erase a segment of flash memory–but that’s a topic
for a later day.</p>

<p>For now, what about that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">scope</a>?  Wouldn’t
it be nice to be able to reset the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">scope</a>
for another capture?  The easiest way I can think of doing that would be
to write the new hold off to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">scope</a>
control register, as in:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="n">m_fpga</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">writeio</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">R_SCOPE_CONTROL</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="o">//</span> <span class="n">New</span> <span class="n">holdoff</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="mi">25</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">clocks</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Or to read from the internal FPGA <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">scope</a>,
wouldn’t it be nice to just simply … read?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">scope_len</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">m_scope_memory</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">m_fpga</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">readio</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">R_SCOPE_DATA</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You do remember how, in our <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">example scope
design</a>, we placed
all of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">scope</a>’s data at the same
register address, right?</p>

<p>We might even manage to optimize successive reads, making a similar command
that could capture any optimizations associated with many reads in a row.
If so, we could write our for loop that read’s from the FPGA into something
that could be optimized, such as:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="n">m_fpga</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">readz</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">R_SCOPE_DATA</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">scope_len</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">m_scope_memory</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Working on Video?  One of the hardest parts of working on Video is getting
that video information in and out of the computer.  Unlike the scope,
your video information is going to occupy successive addresses, rather
than a single data address.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if you could read from your video RAM area exactly what
was being transmitted, as in:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="kt">uint32_t</span>	<span class="n">m_video_image</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NUMBER_OF_PIXELS</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
<span class="n">video_size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">NUMBER_OF_PIXELS</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">m_fpga</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">readi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">R_VIDEO_RAM</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">video_size</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">m_video_image</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then, when we are done, we should close our FPGA interface via a C++ destructor
such as:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="k">delete</span> <span class="n">m_fpga</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Could we make controlling an FPGA that easy?  The answer is, Yes.  Yes, we can.
Not only can this be done, but
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sw/host/wbregs.cpp">wbregs</a>
does it.  Sure, 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sw/host/wbregs.cpp">wbregs</a>
has a lot more code for error handling, and I just added code to look address
names up from linker map files, but simply reading and writing from an
FPGA is what it was designed to do.</p>

<h2 id="this-will-only-hurt-once">This will only hurt once</h2>

<p>Even better, after you go through the pain of building just one debugging
controller for your FPGA, you can then use it for <em>every one</em> of your FPGA
projects.</p>

<p>Think this one over: the debugging interface isn’t going to be graded.
(Ask your instructor if you aren’t sure of that.)  If that’s a problem,
then pull it out of your code before you turn it in.  Either way, if you
use a debugging bus in your design you will have a leg up over all of your
classmates who do not.</p>

<p>Now, consider this sort of interface from the standpoint of the <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">FPGA expert’s
design process</a>.
He’s going to build this sort of interface once, and then he’s going to use it
in all of his projects.  Some time later, he may come back and add a little
bit of capability to it, but he’ll still be using it with every project.</p>

<p>Perhaps an example from my experience would help.  My first design was for
a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users">Basys-3</a> development board.  That’s where
I build the first version of my own <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbubus.v">FPGA debugging
interface</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>After I built that first interface (it was similar to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">hexbus
interface</a> we are
building here) I became frustrated with how slow it was–particularly
when I was using it to read and write new configurations to the flash.</p>

    <p>So, I added compression to the interface: both
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbucompress.v">encoding</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbudecompress.v">decoding</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More recently, I got frustrated with the fact that my interface used up
a serial port, preventing my CPU from printing to the same serial port.</p>

    <p>In this case, I restricted the debugging interface to 7-bits, and used
the high order ASCII bit to determine if the interface was communicating
printable ASCII (such as the CPU with a printf), or unprintable characters
(such as the debugging interface).  Since I was only ever using 7-bit
bytes for the debugging interface in the first place, this change was easy
to do, and it then gave me two channels of data that I could run through
my serial port.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>My point is simply this: You need to pay for your tools.  Pay the time and
energy to build them once and build them well.  Now that they are built,
use them in all of your projects.</p>

<p>Let’s even go one step farther: I’m going to license <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">this hexbus student
interface</a> that we are
building under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">LGPL</a>. 
What that means is that I’ll let you copy it into your project, without being
required to post the rest of the code for your project.  If you improve upon
it, post your improvements.  If you are willing to assign ownership of those
improvements to me, then I’ll post them back into the directory for others to
use.</p>

<p>Once we’re finished, then you, as a student, can play the role of the
expert.  You too can come to the FPGA design problem with a debugging
tool suite under your belt.</p>

<p>This is why I <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">pointed
out</a>, when
discussing how an Expert <em>really</em> does FPGA design, that he comes to the
problem with a lot of tools already in his toolbox.</p>

<h2 id="just-a-simple-vision">Just a simple vision</h2>

<p>All of our work here is simply towards one single goal: to build an interface
to your FPGA that will then simplify all of your interactions with that FPGA.
Such an interface allows us to write commands to the FPGA and to read status
back out of the FPGA.  It will allow us to develop and prove that peripherals
work, and it will help us to find out why they do not work when they do not
work.</p>

<p>This is the component most students don’t realize they are missing within their
design.</p>
