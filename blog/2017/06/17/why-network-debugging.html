    <p>Most FPGA board’s come with some sort of interface port that you can use to
interact with them.  <a href="http://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>’s
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/">Nexys-Video</a>,
<a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/arty-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists">Arty</a>
and <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users">Basys-3</a>
boards each have a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchonous_receiver/transmitter">UART</a>
connection that can be used to interact with the board–as do many of their
other boards.  As a result, the host side interaction can be done using an old
fashioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a> interface. 
The <a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/en/Products/DevelopmentBoardsAndKits/iCEstick.aspx">iCEstick</a> also has a similar interface.</p>

<p>Xess’s <a href="http://xess.com">XuLA2</a> board is a little bit different, in that it
has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG">JTAG</a> port that can be commanded
from a small PIC over a USB port.  However, if you use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG">JTAG</a>
USER command, this port can be turned into
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc/blob/master/rtl/jtagser.v">something that looks, feels, and acts like a serial
port</a>, with
only a touch of <a href="http://libusb.org">libUSB</a> work required.  While I don’t have
any <a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/en/">Terasic</a> boards<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, I’m sure you could use
a similar approach to driving JTAG over USB.</p>

<p>Other boards, such as <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>’s
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod-S6</a>
or the <a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO board</a>, have a parallel type of interface.
While this interface can be turned into a serial stream, and while I have done
this for both interfaces, it takes a bit more work to get going than a
plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a>.</p>

<p>My point is twofold.  First, all of these interfaces will require some work
with the hardware to figure out how to how to send information to the
interface, and how to receive data back from it.  Second, reading and writing
a character stream is the easiest paradigm to consider when interacting with
such a port.  In the case of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial
port</a>, this may have the most O/S
support, since reading from and writing to “/dev/ttyUSBx” is pretty easy.
Other ports that aren’t of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a>
variety can still be made to look, feel, and act like a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a>
even though the underlying transport itself is <em>very</em> different.</p>

<p>My recommendation, which we’ll discuss below, is that you interact with any
character stream-type of interface over a TCP/IP link.</p>

<h2 id="a-networked-interface">A Networked Interface</h2>

<p>If this is your first FPGA project, you might look at what’s available to you
and consider the simplest interface: from your CPU to the device, as in Fig 1.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1: Serial Port Controller</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/raw-dbg.svg" alt="A Serial Port Debugging Controller" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Your first task will be to figure out how to interact with your board.
While proprietary developer software, with all the nice GUI’s that it comes
with, may be the first solution you find, such software usually doesn’t have
the flexibility you’ll need to to do your project.  If your board has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a>, then you have
a generic port you can work with.  If not, feel free to make something
similar.</p>

<p>If your board does have a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a>,
you may be able to interact with it using either a
<a href="http://www.putty.org">putty</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom">minicom</a> terminal.  While this can be
pretty fun, if you ever want to do anything requiring serious communication
with your device (image processing, camera interaction, etc), then you’ll want
a capability that goes beyond what these can provide.  Indeed, even if you have
another interface for handling image transmission, it will help to be able
to get that interface going with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a>, that you can use as
a back up.</p>

<p>In particular, if you want to read <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">scope</a>
information from a design, you are
going to want to run some software to read this data out.  While you <em>might</em>
manage to do it by hand using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom">minicom</a>
terminal for a 64-element scope, but you could), doing it for a 2048 element
scope (or more) <em>really</em> calls for a software solution.  Seriously–let the
computer do the hard work for you.</p>

<p>Other things you might wish to do with your board might include starting or
stopping your on-board logic, reading state registers from the board, initially
loading the memory of your FPGA board, debugging a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">soft-CPU</a> implemented on your board,
or even reading the results of an
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-mic3-mems-microphone-with-adjustable-gain/">analog microphone</a>.</p>

<p>All of these means of interacting with your board need some kind of software
interface.</p>

<p>While all of this may be sound straight forward so far, the problem you will
run into is <em>simulation</em>.  Specifically, it’d be nice to be able to write our
control programs once and have them work both when we are interacting with the
hardware itself, as well as when we are interacting with the simulator.</p>

<p>We’ll create this approach by using TCP/IP, as in Fig 2 below.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2: A Network Based Controller</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/netdbg.svg" alt="A Network Based FPGA Controller" width="720" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Lest you misunderstand the figure, the server need not be a separate computer.
It’s just the other end of the TCP/IP interface.  I often run both ends of
this network link on the same computer.  Further, if you bind the IP address
to “localhost”, then your computer will not open up any external TCP/IP ports
that might be visible to the big internet.  On the other hand, I tend to run
it wide open, so I can work on my laptop just as easily as on my desktop, and
then I port at the firewall.</p>

<p>Somewhere about now I can also hear several students groaning.  Debugging
an FPGA is hard enough, and now I’m recommending that a <em>network</em> debugging
port needs to be added to the FPGA?</p>

<p>Relax–it’s not that bad.</p>

<p>First, the networking debug capability isn’t something you’ll be
graded on.  Therefore I don’t think your instructor will have a problem if you
use someone else’s capabilities, but feel free to check with him/her if you
aren’t sure.</p>

<p>Second, the software you’ll need is all available under the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL</a> already.  You don’t
need to do much more.  If you improve upon it, though, please be kind enough
to the other poor souls out there to share your improvements.  Further, if you
wish to legally give me any of those improvements, I’ll be glad to share them
with the rest of the world as well.</p>

<p>In general, three basic components are required in order to connect a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a> to a TCP/IP port,
as shown in Fig 3.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3: Network S/W Components</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/netcomponents.svg" alt="Network Components Diagram" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You’ll need a piece of software to forward your physical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a>
serial port onto a network port.  You can find an example of that
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/sw/netuart.cpp">here</a>.
You’ll like this piece.  It lets you watch what’s going over the interface,
in case things aren’t working, and so you can debug that interface
in the same window its running in.</p>

    <p>If you are using the parallel port of the <a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO
board</a>, you can find an example of what it would
take to make this interface work with <a href="http://wiringpi.com">wiringPi</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/sw/host/netpport.cpp">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You’ll also need a piece of software to connect your FPGA control
software to.  You can find that piece
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/sw/llcomms.h">here</a>.
You might find right now that this is nothing more than a bare interface.
Don’t worry, it’s the end we are going to connect our software controller
to when we build it.</p>

    <p>If you don’t have this portion of your interface built yet, don’t worry.
As long as you have the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/sw/netuart.cpp">network forwarding piece</a>.
listed above, you can build use
telnet.  As in, <strong>telnet localhost &lt;portnum&gt;</strong>.  This will replace
your need for <a href="http://www.putty.org">putty</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicom">minicom</a>—although if you stick
around, we’ll create a command line approach to interfacing with your board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third piece of software you will need, assuming you can interact with
your device over a serial port, you can find as part of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">wbuart32</a> package
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart/blob/master/bench/cpp/uartsim.cpp">here</a>.
This piece turns the simulation end of the TCP/IP port into a
serial interface that you can process on your simulated board.</p>

    <p>If you have an <a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO board</a> with a parallel
interface, you can find an equivalent software component
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/sim/verilated/dblpipecmdr.h">here</a>.
In this case, while this software provides the same capability, it does it
in a different fashion.  You can look within it to see some of the details.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll discuss how all of these pieces work later and in detail.  For now,
just know that the software is available for you to do this should you have
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a>-type of interface
to your board.</p>

<p>What does this infrastructure allow you to do?  Why is it to your advantage?
It allows you to test your control software in such a manner
that the control software might never know whether the other end of the link
is an FPGA, as in Fig 2. above, or a simulator–as in Fig 4 below.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4: Network Based Simulation</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/netsim.svg" alt="A Network Based FPGA Controller" width="720" /></td></tr></table>

<p>If you can control your simulator over the network, and not know the
difference, then you know your control programs and your simulator work.</p>

<p>That’s where we are headed.</p>

<h2 id="next-time">Next Time</h2>

<p>We’ll come back to these software pieces later to describe how they work in
detail.</p>

<p>For now, we’re going to continue focusing on what it takes to get an initial
debugging interface up and running.  We can debug more complicated interfaces
from there if we need to.</p>

<p>If you’ve never tried using a networking debug interface before, think about it.
As we go over the pieces, give them a try.  My bet is that once you find your
first bug using <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> and
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a> that you’ll become a quick
believer in this method.</p>
