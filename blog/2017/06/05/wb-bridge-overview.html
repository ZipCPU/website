    <p>I’ve now tried to write about how to convert a UART stream to a wishbone master
several times over, and … each time the result has been too complex to
explain within a simple blog post.</p>

<p>So, in good engineering fashion, let’s decompose the problem.  Instead of
presenting an entire wishbone controller, let me instead present you with an
overview of the RTL side of a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbubus.v">working UART to wishbone
bridge</a> that I’ve
now used for many of my projects.  When we build a new/simpler on this blog,
we’ll need to include many of these design elements, so it’s worth taking a
look at.</p>

<p>You can see an outline overview of the parts and pieces I’ve used before
in Fig. 1.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1: WB-UART Overview</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/wb-uart-ovw.svg" alt="Block Diagram of a Working Wishbone to UART converter" width="240" /></td></tr></table>

<h2 id="the-transport-end">The Transport End</h2>

<p>At the top of this figure are the receiver and transmitter. In this design, the
transport layer is a generic 8-bit interface.</p>

<p>Because the transport layer is so generic, it can be provided by either a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/toplevel.v">serial port</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc/blob/master/rtl/jtagser.v">JTAG port</a>,
or even a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a> DEPP channel, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/rtl/deppbyte.v">S6SoC</a> uses.
Indeed, even my work on the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/rtl/pptest/pport.v">ICO
board</a> will
use a fairly generic 8-bit parallel port interface.</p>

<p>There’s one additional requirement to this interface, necessary when the
interface runs over something similar to a SPI port: there must be an idle
character.  That way when a character <em>must</em> be sent, such as when the SPI port
must transmit in order to receive, the idle character can be sent.  To date,
I’ve used an 8’hff for this purpose–but only if I’ve needed it.  That
character can be generated by the transmitter, or quietly dropped in the
receiver.</p>

<h2 id="the-bus-master-end">The Bus Master End</h2>

<p>On the other end of the UART to wishbone bridge is the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbuexec.v">wishbone bus
master</a> that
commands the entire bus interface to the chip.  Any peripheral can be hung off
of such a bus:
<a href="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">flash</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc/blob/master/rtl/wbsdram.v">SDRAM</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip">an AXI bus</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/enetpackets.v">network interface</a>,
an LED/switch/button interface,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/rtcclock">real–time clock</a>,
GPIO,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/wboled.v">OLEDRgb controller</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/wbuart.v">UART controller</a>,
PS/2 mouse controller, and more.</p>

<p>In this case, the bus master accepts commands in the form of 36-bit words. 
These 36-bit words specify to the bus:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What address to use (one word),</li>
  <li>Whether to write one word,</li>
  <li>Whether to stop writing, or</li>
  <li>Whether to read multiple words.</li>
</ol>

<p>The read/write commands also include a bit indicating whether the address
should increment between bus accesses, or whether all of the accesses will
be to the same bus address.</p>

<p>Three specific capabilities of that can be hung off of this bus are worth
mentioning.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the <a href="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">flash controller</a>.
Because I can control the flash over
a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART port</a>, I can read, erase, and
program the flash.  That means that I can reconfigure the entire FPGA over
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART</a>.  Even better, if you connect
one of <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbicapetwo">Xilinx’s ICAPE2 interfaces to the
bus</a>,
you can then load and reload the FPGA’s configuration–without JTAG access.</p>

    <p>The flash interface itself creates a unique requirement of this bus:  When
writing to the flash, the flash controller uses the end of the wishbone
cycle (CYC line goes low) as the signal to start programming the flash.  For
this reason, when writing a series of values, we cannot drop the wishbone
cycle line (CYC) until the last value is written.  Dropping the CYC line is
then the indication to the flash chip that it can start programming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since I’ve spent much of my time building a
   <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">CPU</a>, I’m particularly interested in
   being able to start, step, halt, and reboot the
   <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">CPU</a> from a debug port controlled by
   this interface.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, for the purposes of this blog, this wishbone interface is useful
because you can now control a 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">Wishbone Scope</a>, whether it be a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/wbscope.v">traditional
scope</a> or an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/wbscopc.v">RLE compressed
scope</a> which
you can then use to debug any other part of your design.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That’s how powerful the wishbone bus master is.</p>

<h2 id="characters-to-bits">Characters to Bits</h2>

<p>Since this was my first interface (although now in its 3rd generation), I
needed to be able to read what was going
on.  To accomplish this, I insisted that the interface run over printable
ASCII characters: 0-9, A-Z, a-z, @ and %.  The result is that, if necessary,
I can read the interface by eye and understand what is being sent–although
it does require a (not so secret) decoder ring to do it.</p>

<p>Newlines are treated as out of band characters, and used to end writes that may
currently be in progress.  This keeps us from using a 6-bit interface.</p>

<p>Hence, the first level beneath the transport layer
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbutohex.v">converts printable ASCII into 6-bit
words</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbusixchar.v">back again</a>.</p>

<p>This also slows down the speed of the transport, since the transport
layer can handle 8-bit bytes and we’re only using six of those 8-bit bytes.</p>

<p>Perhaps we can build a better one on this blog as time progresses?</p>

<h2 id="assembling-into-lines">Assembling into lines</h2>

<p>While perhaps not required, the interface does <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbucompactlines.v">assemble responses into
lines</a>.
To do this, it inserts line breaks at the end of any response, or any time the
line would otherwise overflow.</p>

<p>From a user’s standpoint, this makes it a lot easier to synchronize your eyes
to the beginning of commands and responses–especially when/if you need to
debug this interface.</p>

<h2 id="packing-bytes-into-words">Packing Bytes into Words</h2>

<p>Any wishbone bus command requires first knowing whether you wish to read or
write, a bus address, and possible a 32-bit data word.</p>

<p>To do all of these things, you need to be able to assemble 8-bit bytes into
words that are at least 32-bits in length.  That length is the minimum to hold
a 32-bit data word that you wish to write, but by itself it’s not enough.  The
interface must also be able to indicate the type of transaction that is being
requested.</p>

<p>In the example we’ve been following, we <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbureadcw.v">convert six 6-bit characters into a
36-bit word</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbudeword.v">back again</a>.</p>

<p>While 36-bits works, it may be overkill for what we need.  Perhaps we can
drop this down to a 35-bit word?</p>

<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>

<p>UARTs are slow.  Reading an FPGA’s configuration from a flash, so you know
whether or not it needs to be reflashed, over a slow UART link can be <em>painful</em>.
To speed things up, I added compression to this example bridge.
For reading and writing, we use a simple compression scheme based upon a
table of the most recently sent values.  Addresses get compressed based
upon either the difference between them and the last address, or perhaps just
the low order bits of the address might be sent.</p>

<p>You can see the table look up and address decoding logic within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbudecompress.v">decompression
module</a>, or the
logic to see if a codeword to be sent can be found within
a table lookup
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbucompress.v">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="resets-and-interrupts">Resets and Interrupts</h2>

<p>As a final step, the bus interface needs to handle a couple extra pieces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When the bus is idle, the interface should send something periodically so that  you know the FPGA is active on the other end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever an interrupt occurs, you want that information inserted into the
data stream</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This logic is captured in the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/wbuidleint.v">idle-int
module</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you need some form of fault tolerance, so that if a peripheral
doesn’t respond to the bus, the bus can detect that fact, reset the bus,
and return an error across the channel.  We use the same error code for a bus
time out as any generic bus error coming from the bus itself, although
we can usually tell the difference between them.</p>

<p>This watchdog capability is handled in the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/wbubus.v">top
level</a> of the UART
to wishbone bridge.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Since this bus communicates reads and writes of 32–bit words packed into
six 8-bit bytes and transmitted over an 8-bit channel, it takes 60 UART baud
cycles (8N1 encoding) to write one word across the bus (ignoring compression).</p>

<p>If you switch to 7N1 encoding, you can increase your speed by about 10%,
since we were only ever using 7-bits of an 8-bit interface.</p>

<p>Stick with us and we’ll try to beat this number.  Specifically, if we abandon a
6-bits within 8-bit interface and switch to a full 8-bit interface, we should
be able to get down to about 46 baud per word–a 30% speed increase.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we wish to multiplex a console port onto the channel,
we may need to stick with a 7-bit interface.  In that case, perhaps we can
use all seven bits, instead of only 65 of the 128 values?</p>

<h2 id="not-shown">Not Shown</h2>

<p>What isn’t shown in this diagram is the structure of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/sw/host/ttybus.cpp">C++
software</a>
necessary to encode and decode words to send across this bus.</p>

<p>Still, if we can keep the interface to any redesigned bus as simple as the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/sw/host/devbus.h">devbus
interface</a>
that all of our interface software uses, then any software we’ve already
written to use that interface will need to be relinked with the new interface
library, but no other changes will be required.</p>

<h2 id="a-minimal-interface">A minimal interface</h2>

<p>On this blog, we’re going to rebuild this interface.  Our goal will be to
design it in a manner so simple that any college student can build one.
This may mean that we throw out any unused or unnecessary parts and pieces.
We’ll also see if we can’t get our newer, better interface to run faster
than this current one.</p>

<p>The result should be a simpler WB to UART bridge, such as the one shown in
Fig 2.</p>

<table style="float: left"><caption>Fig 2: WB-UART Simplified</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/wb-uart-smpl.svg" alt="Block Diagram of a Simpler Wishbone to UART converter" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Before we can build one of these, though, we’re going to need to spend some
time learning <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-wb-master.html">how to build a wishbone bus master</a> — similar to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbuexec.v">last
one</a>,
but simpler.  Simple enough that it can be understood by the student,
and simple enough that it requires very few hardware resources.  That lesson
will then inform the rest our work redesigning the interface itself.</p>
