    <p>Today, let’s put some things together.  We’ve already built a debugging bus
approach that we can use to interact with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
and draw information out of it.

We’ve also talked about 
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
and what 
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
allows us to do in simulation.</p>

<p>Suppose we spend the time today to build a
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
based simulation of our
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
design that can be controlled via this debugging
bus interface?</p>

<p>While most of the difficult parts have already been accomplished, there are
still there are three basic components that we are going to need to work on to
do this.  The first is the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/Makefile">Makefile for our</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbus.v">top level Verilog design</a>.
The second is the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/testbus_tb.cpp">C++ driver</a> for our test bench.  We already discussed how to
generate a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/testb.h">generic
driver</a>
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">here</a> and our
debugging philosophy in general
<a href="/blog/2017/06/23/my-dbg-philosophy.html">here</a>,
so this discussion will only describe the differences between a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/testb.h">generic test
bench driver</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/testbus_tb.cpp">one we’re
building</a>
for this project.
The last item we’ll need to figure out is how to build all the pieces
together–i.e. the final <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/Makefile">simulation
Makefile</a>.</p>

<p>When we finish, let’s run some tests on our “hardware” and see how it works!</p>

<h2 id="the-rtl-makefile">The RTL Makefile</h2>

<p>The RTL makefile needs to handle two things.  First, it needs to convert our
our <a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">Verilog test
bench</a>
into a C++ class using
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.  Then, the second step
directed by the RTL makefile will be to build that C++ class into a library
that can be linked with our <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/testbus_tb.cpp">C++
testbench</a>
to create a fully functional simulation.</p>

<p>We’ve <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">already
discussed</a>
the basics of how to run
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.
In quick sum here, you can run
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> on a top level Verilog
file as in:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">verilate -Wall -trace -cc testbus.v</code></pre></figure>

<p>Today, let’s just highlight some of the neat things that can be placed into
our rtl/Makefile in order to do it well.</p>

<p>For example, I’d like to be able to use the test bench in the 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">dbgbus</a> repository to test several
different debugging busses.  For this reason, I’m going to add,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span class="nv">BUS</span> <span class="o">:=</span> hexbus</code></pre></figure>

<p>to the Makefile, and -y “../../$(BUS)/rtl” to the
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> command line.
That’ll cause Verilator to look for our sources in the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus/rtl">hexbus</a>
project subdirectory for any bus sources.</p>

<p>Our top level Verilog file
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbench.v">testbench.v</a>
includes references to multiple files.  We’d like
to only re-run Verilator any time these files change.  Is there a way
to get dependency information for Verilog code in a fashion similar to
C++ code?  Yes, there is.  For this, we’ll add “–MMD” to the
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> command line,
and include the dependency file it generates at the end of
our Makefile:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span class="nv">DEPS</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nf">$(</span><span class="nb">wildcard</span> <span class="nv">$(VDIRFB)</span>/<span class="se">\*</span>.d<span class="nf">)</span>

<span class="err">ifndeq</span> <span class="err">($(DEPS),)</span>
<span class="k">include</span><span class="sx"> $(DEPS)</span>
<span class="err">endif</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ll also set two more Makefile variables before we call Verilator.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span class="nv">VERILATOR</span> <span class="o">?=</span> verilator
<span class="nv">VFLAGS</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nt">-Wall</span> <span class="nt">--MMD</span> <span class="nt">-trace</span> <span class="nt">-y</span> ../../<span class="nv">$(BUS)</span>/rtl <span class="nt">--Mdir</span> <span class="nv">$(VDIRFB)</span> <span class="nt">-cc</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will do two things.  First, it will allow you to run make with your
VERILATOR version defined in an environment variable.  Second, it will
simplify our Verilator call later.</p>

<p>Now that we have these variables defined, we can create the “verilate”
target.  This target will build the C++ code.  Since the actual name of the
C++ code is somewhat obtuse, we’ll rename what we are building to “verilate”
and then forward that to what needs to be built.  Finally, we’ll actually
run our Verilator call–simplified by the VFLAGS we defined above.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span class="nl">.PHONY</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">verilate</span>
<span class="nl">verilate</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">$(VDIRFB)/Vtestbus.h</span>
<span class="nl">$(VDIRFB)/Vtestbus.h</span><span class="o">:</span>
	<span class="nv">$(VERILATOR)</span> <span class="nv">$(VFLAGS)</span> testbus.v</code></pre></figure>

<p>The last step is to build the library.  This step is somewhat anticlimactic,
since
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
did most of the work for us.  Building the library depends
upon the source files
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
just built for us.  Making things even easier,
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
just generated its own make file.  Hence,
we’ll just recursively call make on that make file to build all that’s left.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span class="nl">.PHONY</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">library</span>
<span class="nl">library</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">$(VDIRFB)/Vtestbus.h</span>
	<span class="nv">$(SUBMAKE)</span> <span class="nv">$(VDIRFB)</span>/ <span class="nt">-f</span> Vtestbus.mk</code></pre></figure>

<p>This recursively calls make in the $(VDIRFB) subdirectory, and it does so
with the “-f” argument specifying that it should use as its make file
$(VDIRFB)/Vtestbus.mk.</p>

<p>That’s about it.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/Makefile">RTL
Makefile</a>
also contains a clean target, but in general that’s all that it takes to create
a Makefile that will run
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
to build a simulatable library.</p>

<h2 id="the-cpp-testbench">The CPP Testbench</h2>

<p>As <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">we discussed when
presenting</a>
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>,
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
needs a small C++ driver program to run the simulation.</p>

<p>The driver we are going to use for this simulation, both the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/testb.h">generic one</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/testbus_tb.cpp">specific simulation
one</a>,
should look very similar to the ones we built during our <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">prior
discussion</a>.
Here, we’ll look at two differences.</p>

<p>The first is that we have made the termination criteria a touch more
general than before.  For this test bench, we’ll terminate our simulation
either whenever the $final Verilog instruction is reached (which we didn’t
use in our Verilog code), or whenever the <strong>o_halt</strong> GPIO is asserted.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="kt">bool</span>	<span class="n">TESTBUS_TB</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">done</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">m_done</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
		<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Verilated</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">gotFinish</span><span class="p">())</span>
			<span class="n">m_done</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
		<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">m_core</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">o_halt</span><span class="p">)</span>
			<span class="n">m_done</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
		<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">m_done</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’ll allow us to control things from within the simulation (such as by
CPU software instruction) if we’d like.</p>

<p>The other changes are the necessary parts of putting a UART interface
onto this test bench.  We’ll do that using the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/uartsim.cpp">uartsim</a>
simulator found in the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">wbuart</a> repository.  There just a couple
of steps there.</p>

<p>First, we initialize the UART component module with a zero, indicating that
we want the UART to interact with us using stdin/stdout.  We’ll adjust that
later so that we can interact over TCP/IP.</p>

<p>Second, the UART simulator needs to know the baud rate we are using to
communicate with.  This needs to be the same as the UART configuration
parameter found within our
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbus.v">testbus.v</a>.
If you wish to run this on your hardware, you may need to
adjust the parameter in the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbus.v">testbus.v</a>
top level file, as well as in this file–to make sure you are communicating
at a common baud rate.  Otherwise, we’ll just assume that one baud is 25 clock
ticks.  You can check the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/doc/spec.pdf">UART component specification
document</a> for more
information on how to understand this setup value.</p>

<p>That’s it for setting up the C++ portion of the simulation!  All that’s left
is to build it and test it.</p>

<h2 id="the-cpp-makefile">The CPP Makefile</h2>

<p>For building our simulation executable, we return to the Makefile necessary
to do it.  What we want to do is really quite simple.  We’d like to issue
a command such as,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span class="nl">testbus_tb</span><span class="o">:</span>
	<span class="nv">$(CXX)</span> <span class="nv">$(CFLAGS)</span> <span class="nv">$(OBJECTS)</span> <span class="nt">-o</span> <span class="nv">$@</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>where $(OBJECTS) are the object files we need, and $(CFLAGS) are whatever
flags we wish to build with.  Our final solution will be just about that simple.</p>

<p>The questions remaining are, what flags, what objects, and how do we build
those objects.  The
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/Makefile">Makefile</a>
itself includes dependency generation, but we can leave that as a topic for
another day or perhaps even for another blog.</p>

<p>For the first question, which flags shall we use, its in many ways up to you.
We’ll use the “-Og” flag to turn on the optimizer, although any optimizations
should really also be a flag to
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
as well.  Here, we’ll also use the 
“-Wall” flag as well to see if we can encourage g++ to find any bugs in our
code.  We’ll also need to tell
the C++ compiler to look for the include files found both in our RTL/obj_dir
directory, as well as those found in the
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
root include directory.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span class="c"># Show make how to find our compiled verilated output
</span><span class="nv">RTLD</span>  <span class="o">:=</span> ../rtl
<span class="nv">VOBJDR</span><span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nv">$(RTLD)</span>/obj_dir
<span class="c"># Show make how to find Verilators support files
</span><span class="nv">VROOT</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nv">$(VERILATOR_ROOT)</span>
<span class="nv">VINCD</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nv">$(VROOT)</span>/include
<span class="c"># Generate a full include list
</span><span class="nv">INCS</span>  <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nt">-I</span><span class="nv">$(VINCD)</span> <span class="nt">-I</span><span class="nv">$(VOBJDR)</span>
<span class="c"># Build our C-Flags
</span><span class="nv">CFLAGS</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nt">-Og</span> <span class="nt">-g</span> <span class="nt">-Wall</span> <span class="nv">$(INCS)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You might also wish to set the VERILATOR_ROOT directory.  On my system, this
is found in “/usr/share/verilator”, but that’s not the same among all systems.
At the encouragement of others who’ve tried my code, I’ve switched to:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span class="nv">VERILATOR_ROOT</span> <span class="o">?=</span> <span class="nf">$(</span><span class="nb">shell</span> bash <span class="nt">-c</span> <span class="s1">'verilator -V|grep VERILATOR_ROOT | head -1 | sed -e " s/^.*=\s*//"'</span><span class="nf">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will call a shell script, which will run “verilator -V” (try it!).  The
output is then searched for VERILATOR_ROOT.  Since
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
produces two lines with this value within it, we
grab the first one and use it.  Further, we’ll only do so if VERILATOR_ROOT
isn’t already set–perhaps from a parent make file (that’s what the ?= does).</p>

<p>The next question is, what objects do we need to include?  First, there’s
the obvious one, we’ll need to include testbus_tb.o.  We’ll also want to 
include the
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
class definition library from Vtestbus__ALL.a.
Going one step further, we’ll want to include our <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/uartsim.cpp">UART
simulation</a>
object file, uartsim.o.  Finally, we’ll want to include the tw
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
files, verilated.cpp and verilated_vcd_c.cpp once compiled to object files.
This is as easy as:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span class="nv">VSRCRAW</span> <span class="o">:=</span> verilated.cpp verilated_vcd_c.cpp
<span class="nv">VSRC</span>    <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nf">$(</span><span class="nb">addprefix</span> <span class="nv">$(VINCD)</span>/,<span class="nv">$(VSRCRAW)</span><span class="nf">)</span>
<span class="nv">VOBJ</span>    <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nf">$(</span><span class="nb">addprefix</span> <span class="nv">$(OBJDIR)</span>/,<span class="nf">$(</span><span class="nb">subst</span> .cpp,.o,<span class="nv">$(VSRCRAW)</span><span class="nf">))</span>
<span class="nv">SOURCES</span> <span class="o">:=</span> testbus_tb.cpp uartsim.cpp
<span class="nv">OBJECTS</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nf">$(</span><span class="nb">addprefix</span> <span class="nv">$(OBJDIR)</span>/,<span class="nf">$(</span><span class="nb">subst</span> .cpp,.o,<span class="nv">$(SOURCES)</span><span class="nf">))</span> <span class="nv">$(VOBJ)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To build the sources into object files, we’ll add two generic build rules.
The first will apply for the objects built from this directory.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-makefile" data-lang="makefile"><span class="nl">$(OBJDIR)/%.o</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">%.cpp</span>
	<span class="err">$</span><span class="o">(</span>mk-objdir<span class="o">)</span>
	<span class="nv">$(CXX)</span> <span class="nv">$(CFLAGS)</span> <span class="nt">-c</span> <span class="nv">$&lt;</span> <span class="nt">-o</span> <span class="nv">$@</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you are not as familiar with make files, the first line specifies a generic
pattern: files within the current directory and ending with .cpp can be
turned into object files in the $(OBJDIR)/ directory having the same name but
the .o suffix instead.</p>

<p>The second line, $(mk-objdir), calls a function
that we’ll define elsewhere in our makefile that builds our object file
directory, $(OBJDIR).  While it’s not necessary to place your build products
in a separate object file directory, I find that it both cleans up the
main source directory, and it also provides options later in case you need
to build on multiple systems.</p>

<p>The third line is used to call your C++ compiler,
to give it the CFLAGS variable, and to ask it to produce an object file (-c)
rather than a completed program.  Other make file variables include the name
of the source file that tripped the rule, $&lt;, and tell it to place the output
(-o) into $@–the result the rule is supposed to produce.</p>

<p>We repeat this for the
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
source files in the

<p>Since we’ve already presented the final rule, that’s about all there is to
the makefile necessary to generate this simulation.</p>

<p>Should you need to build a make file of your own, you might wish to start
from this one and just change the names of the files necessary to run your
simulation.</p>

<h2 id="simple-tests">Simple Tests</h2>

<p>We now have a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/Makefile">Makefile</a> in
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/bench/rtl">bench/rtl</a>
that will compile our debug bus and a test wishbone interconnect into
a C++ class.  We also have a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/Makefile">Makefile</a> in
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/bench/cpp">bench/cpp</a> that can
then be used to build the project into an executable.  Shall we run our
executable?</p>

<p>Let’s try it out.  The only caution before starting is that this program as
written will generate megabytes of trace information very quickly.  That trace
file, if you aren’t careful, may very well fill up your hard drive.  So, don’t
leave the simulator running at the end of each test.</p>

<p>With all that said, let’s run the program:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">./testbus_tb</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that it’s running, it’s waiting for an input.  So, let’s
try reading our constant address.  If you type,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">A2040R</code></pre></figure>

<p>your design will return “A00002040R20170622”.  The first number, A00002040,
indicates the address that we just changed the interface to.
The second number (starting with the R)
indicates the value we just read: 0x20170622.</p>

<p>Let’s try another.  Let’s try reading that counter, and let’s do it
a couple of times.  The counter itself is at address 0x204c.  However, if you
remember from <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-wb-master.html">when we built our simple bus
master</a>
we chose to use the LSB as indication of whether or not the address should
increment between reads.  By setting it to zero, we’ll keep the address
constant between subsequent read commands.  For this reason, we can issue
an address command, followed by several read commands and they’ll all read
from the same address:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">A204dR
R
R
R</code></pre></figure>

<p>Make sure you type the newlines between the R’s!  This bus isn’t yet robust
enough to handle more than one command given to it at once.  (It needs FIFO
support.)  Still, I get the response:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">A0000204dR000485b4
0005234b
0005cbf1
00068df3</code></pre></figure>

<p>Not bad.  Looks like we’ve got something working.</p>

<p>Can we trigger an interrupt?  You may remember that we had an interrupt
tied to the LSB of address 0x2050.  So, let’s write to 0x2051 to trigger,
clear, and then trigger this interrupt again
I’ll prefix the commands I typed with a “&lt; “, so you can see the responses
in line.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt; A2051RW1
A00002051R00000000K00000000I
&lt; W0
K00000000
&lt; W1
I
K00000000
&lt; W0
K00000000</code></pre></figure>

<p>Did you see the “I” response?  That tells us we triggered our interrupt
as desired.</p>

<p>How about the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/wbscope.v">scope</a>
we put <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbus.v">on
board</a>?  Can
we trigger the scope?  Let’s first
read the scope’s control register, then write to a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/master/bench/rtl/memdev.v">block
RAM</a> memory address
(triggering the scope), and then read the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/wbscope.v">scope</a>’s
control register again:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt; A02080R
A00002080R12a001fc
&lt; A4000Wdeadbeef
A00004000K00000000I
&lt; A2080R
Z
A00002080R72a001fc
&lt; A4000R
A00004000Rdeadbeef</code></pre></figure>

<p>The first command (A02080R) reads from the scopes control register.  If you
look up 0x12a001fc in the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/doc/spec.pdf">wishbone scope specification
document</a>, you’ll
learn several things about the scope’s state as given by this number.  First,
the high order nibble of ‘1’ indicates that the scope is primed but hasn’t
triggered yet.  Second, the ‘2’ indicates that the DATA pointer within the
scope is set to the beginning of the scope’s memory (where we’d expect it). 
Third, the ‘a’ indicates that the scope has been configured for 2^10 samples of
memory.  Last, the ending 0x01fc tells us that the scope will wait 0x01fc
samples after the trigger, placing our event roughly within the center of
its collection window.</p>

<p>The second command, A4000Wdeadbeef, writes 0xdeadbeef to the first location
in block RAM (address 0x4000).  Since we are also using wishbone accesses to
that location to
trigger our scope, an “I” is also returned together with the acknowledgement
(‘K’).  Incidentally, we’ll need to reset the scope in order for this interrupt
to clear, so don’t expect any more interrupt indications for a while.</p>

<p>The third command, “A2080R” reads from the scope control register again.
It now has a value of 0x72a001fc.  Looking at the top nibble, the ‘7’
indicates that the scope has not only been triggered, but that it has also
stopped collecting.</p>

<p>Shall we read from the scope as well?  Let’s read from address 0x2084, with
the increment bit set to prohibit address increments between reads (i.e.,
addres 0x2085):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt; A2080R
A00002080R12a001fc
&lt; A4000Wdeadbeef
A00004000K00000000I
&lt; A2080R
A00002080R72a001fc
&lt; A2085R
A00002085R001b6c00
&lt; R
R001b6c00
&lt; R
R001b6c00
&lt; R
R001b6c00
&lt; R
R001b6c00</code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ve now read our first several values out of the scope!  All three values
were 0x1b6c00.  Sure, there’s more interesting information within the scope,
but we’ll have to dig further into the scope to get it.  The big problem
with getting there, though, is that typing 1024 “R”s to get through all the
values in this scope is going to get old <em>real fast</em>.</p>

<p>We’ve also found some annoying features in the protocol as well.  For example,
there’s no reason why a write acknowledgement should produce 8-zeros,
or why an address response to address 0x2080 should produce the extra four
leading zeros.  Another <em>really</em> annoying feature of not having a FIFO is that
we can’t cut/copy/paste into our interface–that would be a nice feature. 
Still, having valid answers is a good first start!</p>

<p>You can also look in your directory and find a trace.vcd file containing the
trace information we made.  Feel free to run “gtkwave trace.vcd” and explore
what took place after each interaction.</p>

<h2 id="next-in-the-series">Next in the Series</h2>

<p>As with many FPGA capabilities, building it just the way you want it can take
several iterations.  We’ve got some more iterations yet left in this design.</p>

<p>We’re still missing two final capabilities before we put this series to rest
and move on to other topics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We’d like to have a <a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">software
interface</a>
to debug both our FPGA and our simulation.</p>

    <p>If you haven’t noticed, typing hexadecimal commands and values, and
interpreting hexadecimal results isn’t very intuitive.  Indeed, it’s
out right <em>cryptic</em>!  We’ll fix this by switching from this by-hand interface
to a software interface.</p>

    <p>That software interface has been written, though not yet posted at this time.
(Any <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">Patreon supporters</a> want to try an
early version?) You’ll find it a whole lot easier to interact with large
amounts of data over a software driven interface.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to be able to debug our simulation just like we would debug the
hardware, by using a <a href="/blog/2017/06/17/why-network-debugging.html">network enabled
interface</a>.  The
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/cpp/uartsim.cpp">UART simulator</a> has this capability within it already.  Our hardware does not.
Hence, we’d like to take a program like the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sw/host/netuart.cpp">netuart</a>
from the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic">basic ZipCPU</a> repository and
incorporate it into this debugging bus.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It may now be time to go back and consider the difference between the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">student’s design process and the expert’s design
process</a>.  Consider
how much work it has taken to build this design, and then consider the typical
student project.  The difference helps to illustrate why what we are building
is a tool that a professional might use.  The reason is simply that building it
takes time.  In the case of the professional, the time is spent once, and the
tool used many times over.  In the case of the student who is trying to build
a design from start to finish within a semester, the student often doesn’t
realize the value of the tool he doesn’t have.</p>
