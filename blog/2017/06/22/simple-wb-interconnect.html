    <p>Want to build a scope?  Seriously!  Want to turn your FPGA into a scope that
can measure anything internal to your logic, and then make that information
available to you upon request?  Even better, you could use this scope to
capture samples from an external analog to digital converter if you wanted to.</p>

<p>It’s time to do build the Verilog to do it!</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1: WB-UART Overview</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/wb-uart-smpl-2.svg" alt="Block Diagram of a Simpler Wishbone to UART converter" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Ok, here’s where we are at in this process: We now have all of the components
necessary to build a debugging bus interface.  We’ve now built <em>all</em> of the
components outlined in Fig 1 to the right.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We’ve presented an <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">overview of a UART to wishbone
bridge</a>, that
can be used for debugging.  This overview presented not only how to
build such a bridge, but also showed examples from a working one that I use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then jumped to the end to discuss how to build a <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-wb-master.html">Simple Wishbone
Master</a>.  While the
principles there can be applied to creating any
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a> master interface,
we’ve shown how to use the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbexec.v">code presented
there</a>
as part of our own debugging interface.  In particular, it’s the
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a> master
we’ll use today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We showed how you can use the inputs from a serial port to <a href="/blog/2017/06/14/creating-words-from-bytes.html">create bus
command words</a>.  That finished out our discussion of the input to this bus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then showed how to <a href="/blog/2017/06/15/words-back-to-bytes.html">turn the bus master responses back into a serial
stream</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before we finished, we added <a href="/blog/2017/06/16/adding-ints.html">interrupt notifications to our
interface</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And then we <a href="/blog/2017/06/16/adding-ints.html">added an idle indication</a> to the interface as well, so that we can have some confidence
that the interface is running on any given serial port / transport.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final post in the building the bus master interface was a post
describing <a href="/blog/2017/06/20/dbg-put-together.html">how to put it all
together</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Today, we’re going to build something that this interface can interact with.
When we’re done, the result won’t (yet) look like something a professional
tool might produce, but it’ll be enough for a demonstration.  We’ll
save the professional looking part for another lesson.</p>

<h2 id="our-components">Our Components</h2>

<p>If we want to build a bus that connects things together, the first step is going
to be collecting the components together that we want to interface with.
So, I’ve pulled several components from other designs that I have.
I’ve also adjusted their copyright so that, as part of this project, you can
have access to these components under the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">LGPL</a>.  These
components include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/memdev.v">block

drawn from the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">wbaurt32</a> repository.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As a legal note, the RTL designs these examples were taken from still remain
firmly under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL</a>, only
these specific component files have been given a new copyright.</p>

<table style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 2: System Diagram</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/sample-interconnect.svg" alt="An example WB interconnect" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Of course, we’ll also be using the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">hexbus debugging
interface</a> we’ve just
developed and presented as part of this blog.</p>

<p>The basic design is going to be similar to Fig 1, but with the new components
added in as part of the bus, as shown in Fig 2.</p>

<p>Of these new components, the only one we haven’t discussed is a simple
ad hoc component that we’ll discuss below, and that you can use to get access
to arbitrary values within your design, and so that you have a little bit of
an example of some of the things that can be done.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-the-components">Connecting the components</h2>

<p>There are three parts to connecting components to a
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a> bus.
First, you must decode the components’ address, so that only the proper
component is addressed.
Second, you must merge the three basic
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
slave outputs back into one
response to be returned to the master.  These include the <strong>_ack</strong> line,
the <strong>_stall</strong> line, and the return <strong>_data</strong> line.
Third, although not required, painful prior errors have taught me to always
create a <strong>wb_err</strong> return line, and to set that any time a non-existent
component is addressed.  Further, along those same lines, we’re going to
make sure that no components occupy the NULL address.</p>

<h3 id="wiring-up-the-bus-master">Wiring up the bus master</h3>

<p>Prior to the first step, though, we’ll need to wire up our UART receiver, our
debugging bus
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
master, and our UART transmitter.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">rxuartlite #(UARTSETUP) rxtransport(i_clk,
				i_uart, rx_stb, rx_data);

hbbus	genbus(i_clk,
	// The receive transport wires
	rx_stb, rx_data,
	// The bus control output wires
	wb_cyc, wb_stb, wb_we, wb_addr, wb_odata, wb_sel,
	//	The return bus wires
	  wb_ack, wb_stall, wb_err, wb_idata,
	// An interrupt line
	bus_interrupt,
	// The return transport wires
	tx_stb, tx_data, tx_busy);

txuartlite #(UARTSETUP) txtransport(i_clk,
				tx_stb, tx_data, o_uart, tx_busy);</code></pre></figure>

<p>This is primarily an exercise in wire management: the outputs of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/rxuartlite.v">receiver</a>
go into the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">hexbus</a>,
and the outputs from the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">hexbus</a> decoder
go into the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/txuartlite.v">transmitter</a>
and control the wishbone bus. Still, one particular
parameter needs some attention: the <strong>UARTSETUP</strong>.  This parameter is
defined within the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">wbuart32</a> project.
If we want to communicate using 8-bits per baud, no parity, and one
stop bit, (8N1) then we can set this parameter simply to the number of clocks
per baud.  Hence, if we want to run our interface at 4MBaud with a
100MHz clock, we should set this to (100MHz/4MBaud) or 25.</p>

<h3 id="the-address-select-lines">The address select lines</h3>

<p>Next, let’s handle our address select lines.  We’ll support three basic
components, and we’ll use the prefixes of <strong>smpl_</strong> (for our ad-hoc
registers), <strong>mem_</strong> (for our block RAM) and <strong>scop_</strong> to describe them.
Handling address selection is done in two parts.  For the first part,
we just test whether or not the
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
address matches the address we’ve given to this component:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">// Nothing should be assigned to the null page
assign	smpl_sel = (wb_addr[29:4] == 26'h081);	// 0x00002040
assign	scop_sel = (wb_addr[29:4] == 26'h082);	// 0x00002080
assign	mem_sel  = (wb_addr[29:12] ==18'h1);	// 0x00004000</code></pre></figure>

<p>One caution is in order: our bus address lines reference 32-bit words, not
octets.   Address 0x810 above references one 32-bit word, while address
0x811 references
another 32-bit word.  Most people are more familiar with accessing a bus where
the address is in units of octets.  For this reason, we’ve written out the
octet equivalent of each address in the comment to the right.  This equivalent
is given by shifting the address up by two, as well as by the number of
unspecified bits (4 or 12) in the address.</p>

<p>This is actually a good time to point out that there’s really a <em>lot</em> more
work to be done to do address assignment properly than just these simple
decode lines above.
A specification document needs to be written outlining what addresses are
being used for what, the addresses need to be turned into C/C++ address
references for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sw/host/wbregs.cpp">peek/poke by name
interface</a> and
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">CPU</a>, and more.
Here, we’re just going to wave our hands and assign these three address groups
to peripherals.</p>

<p>We’ll probably have to come back and fix this lack in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="bus-errors">Bus Errors</h3>

<p>I usually define a
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
bus error as one of three things.  First, it is an error if <em>nothing is
selected</em> during a
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
operation.  Second, it is an
error if <em>more than one</em> thing is ever selected.  Finally, it is an error if
<em>more than one acknowledgement</em> is returned on any given clock.  For our
example purposes here, we’ll only set the error is nothing is selected.
That is, if the <strong>wb_stb</strong> signal is high indicating a
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
request, and yet the address in <strong>wb_addr</strong> doesn’t reference any of our
components, then a bus error should be returned.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">// This will be true if nothing is selected
assign	none_sel = (!smpl_sel)&amp;&amp;(!scop_sel)&amp;&amp;(!mem_sel);

// The wishbone error signal is true for one clock only, and then it
// resets itself
always @(posedge i_clk)
	wb_err &lt;= (wb_stb)&amp;&amp;(none_sel);</code></pre></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">spec</a>,
though, isn’t as particular regarding what constitutes a
bus error, and many masters want any error detected to be aligned with where
the acknowledgement would’ve come back–so that every request ends in either
an error or an acknowledgement.  That approach allows both slaves and the
interconnect to generate errors.  The interconnect we are building today,
though is simpler, and doesn’t do that.</p>

<p>We’ll do one more thing with the bus error: we’ll grab a copy of any bus
error address, so we can report back later the bus address associated with
any error (if necessary):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">always @(posedge i_clk)
	if (wb_err)
		bus_err_address &lt;= wb_addr;</code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ll come back to logic required of the interconnect later, once we handle
the slave produced signals.</p>

<h3 id="slave-response-the-stall-line">Slave response: The stall line</h3>

<p>The first slave response logic we’ll look at is the stall logic.
The <a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">spec</a>,
recommends that this logic not be clocked, and that it be only combinatorial
in nature.  In particular, you’ll want to stall the bus any time you are
trying to make a request of a component whose stall line is high.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">assign	wb_stall = ((smpl_sel)&amp;&amp;(smpl_stall))
		||((scop_sel)&amp;&amp;(scop_stall))
		||((mem_sel)&amp;&amp;(mem_stall));</code></pre></figure>

<p>For this particular bus implementation, the stall lines are just a formality.
None of these <a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
slave’s will ever stall the bus.  This line is therefore 
ripe for being removed by the optimizer within your toolflow.  Here, we keep
it in case we need to add components later that might stall the bus.</p>

<h3 id="slave-response-the-acknowledgement">Slave response: The Acknowledgement</h3>

<p>The second slave response line is the acknowledgement line.  This is the line
that the slave uses to indicate that the data it is providing on its data line
is valid.  We’ll handle this by creating a clocked line that is simply the <em>or</em>
of all the acknowledgement lines.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">always @(posedge i_clk)
	wb_ack &lt;= (smpl_ack)||(scop_ack)||(mem_ack);</code></pre></figure>

<p>If we use a clock while assigning our data, the two resulting responses,
both acknowledgement and data, will align as required.</p>

<h3 id="slave-response-return-data">Slave response: Return data</h3>

<p>The final slave responses are the data lines.  These are valid any time the
acknowledgement is valid.  Indeed, we’ll use the various slave acknowledgement
lines to know which slave has produced valid data, and thus to know what data
to return to the
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a> master.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">always @(posedge i_clk)
	if (smpl_ack)
		wb_idata &lt;= smpl_data;
	else if (scop_ack)
		wb_idata &lt;= scop_data;
	else if (mem_ack)
		wb_idata &lt;= mem_data;
	else
		wb_idata &lt;= 32'h0;</code></pre></figure>

<p>As a touch of flair, we’ll respond with all zeros if nothing acknowledges our
bus read, although this isn’t required and it can be removed if necessary
if you are struggling to <a href="/blog/2017/06/12/minimizing-luts.html">minimize your
logic</a>.</p>

<h3 id="slave-response-interrupts">Slave response: Interrupts</h3>

<p>Although it’s not really a part of connecting a device to a
<a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone"><em>Wishbone</em> bus</a>,
many bus slaves have interrupt lines.  We’ll create an interrupt
to send back to our debugging bus controller that is simply the <em>or</em> of our
two interrupt producing components.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">assign	bus_interrupt = (smpl_interrupt) | (scop_int);</code></pre></figure>

<p>Given the way we implemented interrupts within our controller, this will
trigger on any positive edge–so it’ll need to be reset prior to being
able to trip again.  While it’s not necessarily the optimal or the best
approach, it may be sufficient for our purposes here.</p>

<h3 id="connecting-the-pre-existing-components">Connecting the pre-existing components</h3>

<p>We have three components to connect our interface to.  Two of these components
already exist and only need to be referenced from here as sub-modules.  These
are the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/memdev.v">block
RAM</a>
interface, and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/wbscope.v">wishbone
scope</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/memdev.v">block RAM</a>
needs very little additional configuration beyond what we’ve
already done, but it does need to to be told how big its memory area will be. 
We’ll create our
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/memdev.v">block RAM</a>
to have 2^14 octets, hence the <strong>14</strong> parameter below.  We’ll
also use the select line, that we set above, <strong>mem_sel</strong>, to modify the
slaves strobe line, so the memory knows that it has been selected–without
needing to have any more knowledge of any other peripherals that might be
on the bus.  This is different from the <strong>wb_sel</strong> line which we’ve <a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/29/select-lines.html">used to
determine which octets in a word will be set in any
operation</a>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">memdev	#(14) blkram(i_clk,
	wb_cyc, (wb_stb)&amp;&amp;(mem_sel), wb_we, wb_addr[11:0],
		wb_odata, wb_sel,
	mem_ack, mem_stall, mem_data);</code></pre></figure>

<p>The next item we’ll want to place onto our bus is the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a>.</p>

<p>To use the scope, you must decide on what you wish to examine, and then
what you want to use to trigger the scope.  In our case, let’s trigger
off of any <a href="https://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
accesses to our block RAM.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">assign	scope_trigger = (mem_sel)&amp;&amp;(wb_stb);</code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ll also select for our scope’s data several of the bus lines.  We’ll save
for a later date how to turn these wires into a proper VCD file.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">assign	debug_data    = { wb_cyc, wb_stb, wb_we, wb_ack, wb_stall,
		wb_addr[5:0], 1'b1,
			wb_odata[9:0],
			wb_idata[9:0] };</code></pre></figure>

<p>The scope has one more capability: it can sample data based upon a “when data
is valid” flag.  The flag can be <em>really</em> useful if you are processing a
signal that isn’t valid on every clock–such as the output of a digitizer as
an example.  Today, we’ll just set that flag to one so that we can capture
on every clock.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">assign	scope_ce = 1'b1;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that all of the preliminaries have been taken care of, you can now place
the scope within our file, and connect it to the bus as well.  As with the
memory, the biggest part of “hooking it up” is adjusting the strobe line by
<em>and</em>ing it with the scope select line.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">wbscope	thescope(i_clk, scope_ce, scope_trigger, debug_data,
	i_clk, wb_cyc, (wb_stb)&amp;&amp;(scop_sel), wb_we, wb_addr[0],wb_odata,
	scop_ack, scop_stall, scop_data,
	scop_int);</code></pre></figure>

<p>Other things you might notice are the fact that this scope requires
two clocks, one for the data and one for the bus.  In this example
thee two are the same.  It
also requires the lowest of the address lines.  The result is that address
<strong>0x02080</strong> will reference the scope control and status register, while
address <strong>0x2084</strong> will reference the scope data register.</p>

<h3 id="building-an-ad-hoc-slave">Building an Ad-Hoc Slave</h3>

<p>You will very often find that you need to be able to report some logic result
back up the bus to your debug interface–something that is ad-hoc, and not
necessarily the part of any well-defined, prebuilt component.  In many ways,
this seems to be one of the most common requests: how to I get access to
(whatever) to see what my design has done?  Therefore, let’s make a simple
ad-hoc slave that does just that.</p>

<p>Our slave will have six registers, although it occupies enough bus space
that it could have a full sixteen–so there’s plenty of room should you wish
to expand it.  Any more than that and you’ll need to adjust the address
decoding logic above.  Laying these registers out, we’ll have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A read only date register</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A simple register that you can set and read back</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The address of the last bus error</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A counter that starts from zero on startup</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An experimental interrupt line, that you can use to turn an interrupt on or
off, so you can see how our interface deals with an interrupt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A GPIO output that you can use to communicate with the
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator/">Verilator</a> simulation.
In this case, we’ll use an <strong>o_halt</strong> flag to indicate that its time for
the simulation to halt.  You can set that as part of the LSB of this
register.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s first handle the write request.  On a write, to this peripheral,
we’ll:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Handle setting the simple register to whatever input was given</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create (or clear) an interrupt depending on the low order bit if writing
to register four</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adjust our <strong>o_halt</strong> GPIO value with the LSB of anything written
to register five.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Since the other registers are read only, we can ignore them on any write
request.</p>

<p>This is therefore our write request logic:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">always @(posedge i_clk)
	// Determine if a write to this peripheral is taking place
	if ((wb_stb)&amp;&amp;(smpl_sel)&amp;&amp;(wb_we))
	begin // Split our logic between the registers
		case(wb_addr[3:0])
		4'h1: smpl_register  &lt;= wb_odata;
		4'h4: smpl_interrupt &lt;= wb_odata[0];
		4'h5: o_halt         &lt;= wb_odata[0];
		default: begin end
		endcase
	end</code></pre></figure>

<p>In this case, pay close attention to the if at the top, and the case below.
These should match up with our <a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/29/simple-wishbone.html">lesson on how to build a simple wishbone
slave</a>.</p>

<p>Before reading back from this interface, let’s deal with the “clocks since
power up” counter.  We’re going to use the initial command to set this
register to zero, then while running it will count up.  Once the MSB gets set,
we’ll leave it set so that we can tell if we’ve ever rolled over.  This will
give us an ever changing counter that we can use for relative timing, or
absolute timing if near when the chip starts up.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">// Start our clocks since power up counter from zero
initial power_counter = 0;
always @(posedge i_clk)
	// Count up from zero until the top bit is set
	if (!power_counter[31])
		power_counter &lt;= power_counter + 1'b1;
	else // once the top bit is set, keep it set forever
		power_counter[30:0] &lt;= power_counter[30:0] + 1'b1;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we’ve created that logic, everything is ready for us to read.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">always @(posedge i_clk)
	case(wb_addr[3:0])
	4'h0:    smpl_data &lt;= 32'h20170622;
	4'h1:    smpl_data &lt;= smpl_register;
	4'h2:    smpl_data &lt;= { bus_err_address, 2'b00 };
	4'h3:    smpl_data &lt;= power_counter;
	4'h4:    smpl_data &lt;= { 31'h0, smpl_interrupt };
	default: smpl_data &lt;= 32'h00;
	endcase</code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice that read logic doesn’t depend upon any bus lines other than the
address.  Indeed, the fact that a read of this device has taken place is in
many ways irrelevant–only the data being produced is relevant.  We can
produce the right result for any address in our register space regardless. 
(This isn’t true for all peripherals.)  The zero address of our peripheral
returns a constant value (of the day when I posted this).  The first address
(address 4, really) just returns the register we set above.  The second
address gives us the address of the last bus error.  The third gives us the
value of our ticks since startup counter.  The final register, at address
position four (0x2050), just returns an LSB indicating whether or not our
interrupt is set.</p>

<p>Since the last address in our interface only contains a halt request
indicator, it will never read anything but zero, so we’re not going to
include any special logic to read it.</p>

<p>As a final and required part of our interface, we’ll need to acknowledge the
response from the bus, and create a stall line to indicate that this ad-hoc
interface never stalls.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">// Decoding an address takes one clock, so set the ACK to be true
// on the next clock
always @(posedge i_clk)
	smpl_ack &lt;= ((wb_stb)&amp;&amp;(smpl_sel));

// This simple interface never stalls
assign smpl_stall &lt;= 1'b0;</code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it!  You just connected a (very) simple peripheral to our debugging
bus!  Indeed, if you wanted, you could now use this approach to
<a href="/blog/2017/05/29/fft-debugging.html">debug an FFT</a></p>

<h1 id="coming-up">Coming up</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">full design</a>, as we’ve now built it
should run on any FPGA.  A quick test, by giving the device an address and
read request,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">A2040R</code></pre></figure>

<p>or similarly a hex address and a write request,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">A4000Wdeadbeef</code></pre></figure>

<p>should work to read or write from your device using this interface.  Further,
if nothing is going on, you should be able to see “Z”s getting sent to your
screen.</p>

<p>Not bad.</p>

<p>We could even read from the scope’s control and status register with a
simple read command:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">A2080R</code></pre></figure>

<p>Another read command, such as</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">A2085R</code></pre></figure>

<p>will return one data value from our scope.  You might wish to notice that we
set the LSB in this address.  As a result, subsequent R’s typed into the
interface will interpreted as read commands from <em>the same</em> 
“scope data register” address.</p>

<p>Ok, so … this works.  But it’s still really hard to use.  This, then, gives
us our roadmap forward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Building a
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator/">Verilator</a>
<a href="/blog/2017/06/26/dbgbus-verilator.html">test bench</a>
to use to experiment with this bus apart from any hardware</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building a <a href="/blog/2017/06/29/sw-dbg-interface.html">software interface</a> to our debugging bus, so we can use
the host CPU to our advantage when working with the design</p>

    <p>This software interface will also make it easier for us to get the results
of any scope interactions out of our debugging harness and into a VCD
type of format that we can then use to examine what was going on within the
FPGA.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These then will be the topics we will queue up for a later day.</p>
