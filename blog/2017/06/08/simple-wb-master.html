    <p>Explaining how to build a good <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">wishbone controlled debug
port</a>
may take a couple of posts to do right.  Worse, it may take us a couple of
rounds just to get the logic right, but let’s try anyway.</p>

<table style="float: left"><caption>Fig 1: WB-UART Overview</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/wb-uart-smpl.svg" alt="Block Diagram of a Simpler Wishbone to UART converter" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>For this post, we’re going to concentrate on the wishbone bus master found
at the bottom of the simplified UART to wishbone converter, as outlind in
Fig 1.</p>

<p>Hence, if the whole capability will eventually look like Fig 1, we’re only
looking at the component at the very bottom within this post, and even then
we’re only going to examine a simplified version of it.  We’ll leave the
implementation of multiple transactions at once for a later date.</p>

<p>My strategy for this blog post will be to come back and update it later
with any updates or fixes, so (hopefully) any mistakes will get fixed over
time.</p>

<p>We are going to try to take this opportunity to build a simple wishbone bus
master.  Before starting, you may wish to grab a copy of the
<a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">wishbone bus specification</a> and
follow along in the
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">B4 version</a>.</p>

<p>You can find definitions for the various wishbone interface
wires in chapter two.  We’re going to continue following our practice of
prepending input wires with <strong>i_…</strong> and output wires with <strong>o_..</strong>, even
though the specification appends similar notes.  We’re also going to add
the <strong>_wb_</strong> designator to all of the inputs associated with the wishbone
bus.  Hence, <strong>i_wb_ack</strong> will reference the return acknowledgement from
the slave.</p>

<p>Chapter three of the 
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">spec</a> describes how the
various wishbone wires compose a bus cycle.
We’ll specifically be implementing the <em>pipelined bus cycle</em> (not the classic
bus cycle), and we’re eventually going to build our implementation so that
it can issue requests across the bus in a pipelined fashion as fast as the
slave will allow it.</p>

<p>If you are a visual learner, check out figures 3-6, and 3-8 from
<a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">the specification</a>.
I find these to be the most useful, as I’m explaining how the bus works.
We’ll reserve the capability shown in Figures 3-11 and 3-13 for a later post.</p>

<p>For today’s post, we’ll handle a single bus interaction per bus cycle, so
the CYC line will be lowered between requests.  We’ll revisit this decision
in a later post so that we can issue multiple requests of the bus at
one request per clock, but that will be a later discussion.</p>

<p>Further, you can see the code as we’re building it in the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">dbgbus</a> project
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbexec.v">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-control-interface">The Control Interface</h2>

<p>The bus master interface we are building will ultimately be commanded from an
external interface.  We’ve
<a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">already discussed</a>
how that one might wish to do this over <a href="http://icoboard.org">ICO board</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/rtl/pptest">parallel port</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART</a>, SPI, or
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc/blob/master/rtl/jtagser.v">JTAG</a>. 
Exactly which is used will be external to our bus master implementation.</p>

<p>We’ll have to build up the functionality in our control interface 
as we build up the whole interface.  The two sort of go together.</p>

<p>For now, let’s handle all of our communication using 34-bit words.  We’ll use
the top 2-bits of these 34-bit words for signaling, and then the bottom 32 for
any values we wish to pass.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">input		i_reset;
input		i_cmd_stb;
input	[33:0]	i_cmd_word;
output	reg	o_cmd_busy;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Our input data word will be valid any time <strong>i_cmd_stb</strong> is valid, but it will only
be accepted whenever <strong>o_cmd_busy</strong> is false.  Hence, when you read the code, you
may find (<strong>i_stb</strong>)&amp;&amp;(!<strong>o_cmd_busy</strong>).  This will be the indication a
request has been accepted.</p>

<p>For now, we’ll just set <strong>o_cmd_busy</strong> to be true any time the bus is active.
Eventually, we’ll want to take a peek at the next bus request, and drop 
<strong>o_cmd_busy</strong> if the next request is one we are interested in.  For example,
if we are busy doing something and the user requests a bus reset, we’ll
need to drop the busy line and accept that request.</p>

<p>For our command words, we’ll use the following definition to define how the
34-bit control words will be interpreted:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>33</th>
      <th>32</th>
      <th>31 - 0</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Read request, ignore the rest of the 32-bits, ACK on output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Write request, the 32-bit data contains the word to be written</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Set an address.  If bit 31 is set, we’ll add this value to the current bus address.  If bit 30 is set, the address will be incremented upon each bus access</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>4’h0, 28’hxx, Bus Reset</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Our signaling scheme will allow us to issue a bus reset command, which will
abruptly cause us to abandon any bus cycle we may be in the middle of.  To
make this work, the bus reset request will need to override the busy flag.</p>

<p>This is not the most efficient scheme.  For example, why send 34-bits when
you are only going to pay attention to two of them (i.e. the read)?  Wouldn’t
it make more sense to send a smaller number of bits for the read, together with
the number of items you intend to read?  Yes, it would.  Optimizing this command
word will be the subject of another post.</p>

<p>The output of our bus will use (almost) the exact same approach.  We’ll create
a <strong>o_rsp_stb</strong> signal that will be true any time the output references a
valid codeword.  Unlike the input, though, we’ll ignore any flow control on the 
output.  We can add some amount of flow control back in later with
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbufifo.v">a FIFO</a>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">input		o_rsp_stb;
input		o_rsp_word;</code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ll also borrow from the input codeword encoding for the return trip encoding,
as shown below:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>33</th>
      <th>32</th>
      <th>31 - 0</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Acknowledge a write.  The 32-bit value contains number of writes to acknowledge</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Read response, the 32 data bits are the word that was read</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Acknowledge an address that has been set, with two zero bits and 30 address bits</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>3’h0, 29’hxx, Bus Reset acknowledgement</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>3’h1, 29’hxx, Bus Error</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="decoding-the-control-interface">Decoding the Control Interface</h2>

<p>We have only four different types of command words in our code book.
In the first section of our simple bus master, we’ll create
flags to indicate which request is currently being made.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">assign	i_cmd_rd   = (i_cmd_stb)&amp;&amp;(i_cmd_word[33:32] == 2'b00);
assign	i_cmd_wr   = (i_cmd_stb)&amp;&amp;(i_cmd_word[33:32] == 2'b01);
// We'll use i_cmd_bus to capture whether we have a read or write request
assign	i_cmd_bus  = (i_cmd_stb)&amp;&amp;(i_cmd_word[33]    == 1'b0);
//
assign	i_cmd_addr = (i_cmd_stb)&amp;&amp;(i_cmd_word[33:32] == 2'b10);
assign	i_cmd_special = (i_cmd_stb)&amp;&amp;(i_cmd_word[33:32] == 2'b11);</code></pre></figure>

<p>You may notice that I have violated my naming convention with these wires:
I have named locally generated wires with an <strong>i_…</strong> prefix when they are
not actual inputs to our bus master module, but rather the results of
combinatorial logic applied to inputs.  In this case, it tends to work
out, but it’s not something I’m regularly going to do.</p>

<h2 id="the-wishbone-master-interface">The Wishbone Master Interface</h2>

<p>This bus controller will have three basic states, as shown in Fig 2.</p>

<table syle="float: none; align: center"><caption>Wishbone Master State Transition Diagram</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/wb-simple-master.svg" alt="Simple Bus Master state transition diagram" width="700" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Here’s a quick description of each of those states:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>IDLE</em>: When we are doing nothing, both CYC and STB must be low.  In this
state, we’ll need to be responsive to incoming requests from the bus.
Upon a request, we’ll need to set the request direction (<strong>o_wb_we</strong>),
the data lines (<strong>o_wb_data</strong>) and then CYC and STB.</p>

    <p>We’ll also set our address lines in this state, but without adjusting
CYC or STB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>BUS REQUEST</em>: When CYC and STB are both high, a bus request is taking
place.  This request phase lasts until <strong>i_wb_stall</strong> goes low, at
which point our request has been accepted.</p>

    <p>When we come back to this code later and transition it to handling multiple
requests, we will transition from one request
to the next any time <strong>o_wb_stb</strong> is true and <strong>i_wb_stall</strong> is false.</p>

    <p>It is also possible that the acknowledgement might be received on the same
clock the transaction was requested.  We’ll need to make certain we deal
with this case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>BUS RESPONSE</em>: After making a request of the bus, we need to wait until
the slave acknowledges it.  Every acknowledgement will lead us to sending
another response across our command interface back up our command stream.
More importantly, every read response will also need to carry the value
read from the <strong>i_wb_data</strong> data lines in its payload.  We’ll need to
make certain we return those back to the user.</p>

    <p>Once the last acknowledgement is received, we can transition back to the
idle state.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are a couple of exceptions to this model: if a bus error occurs, we’ll
simply abandon the current transaction.  This approach has the inherent
problem in it that acknowledgements may come back later and get mixed with
another bus request.  For now, we’ll accept that risk and do it anyway,
since it may be the only way to recover the bus if a peripheral is
non-responsive.</p>

<h3 id="simplified-overview">Simplified Overview</h3>

<p>If you’re still somewhat new to digital design and coming from the
software world, your first approach to building a Wishbone Bus Master might
look something like the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">initial	o_wb_cyc = 1'b0;
initial	o_wb_stb = 1'b0;

	newaddr &lt;= 0;

	// Return over the command interface that we just had an error,
	// or a bus reset
	if (i_reset)
		o_rsp_word &lt;= `RSP_RESET;
	else
		o_rsp_word &lt;= `RSP_BUS_ERROR;
end else if ((i_cmd_stb)&amp;&amp;(!o_cmd_busy))
begin
	//
	// In the idle state
	//
	newaddr &lt;= 0;
	if (i_cmd_addr)
	begin
		if (!i_cmd_word[1])
			o_wb_addr &lt;= i_cmd_word[29:0];
		else
			o_wb_addr &lt;= i_cmd_word[29:0] + o_wb_addr;

		inc &lt;= !i_cmd_word[0];

		// Acknowledge the new address -- on the next clock
		// (after the add has completed)
		newaddr &lt;= 1'b1;
	end

	if (newaddr)
	begin
		o_rsp_stb &lt;= 1'b1;
		o_rsp_word &lt;= { `RSP_SUB_ADDR, o_wb_addr, 1'b0, !inc };
	end

	o_wb_we &lt;= (i_cmd_wr);

	// On a read or write request, activate the bus and go to the bus
	// request state
	if (i_cmd_bus)
	begin
		o_wb_cyc &lt;= 1'b1;
		o_wb_stb &lt;= 1'b1;
		o_cmd_busy   &lt;= 1'b1;
	end

	if (i_cmd_wr)
		o_wb_data &lt;= i_cmd_word[31:0];
end else if (o_wb_stb)
begin
	newaddr &lt;= 1'b0;
	//
	// BUS REQUEST state
	//
	// In the state where we are commanding the bus, and waiting for
	// the bus request to be accepted
	//
	// o_wb_cyc will also be true here, since we cannot allow
	// o_wb_stb to be true if o_wb_cyc is not true.  (Too many
	// peripherals depend upon this bus simplification ...)
	//
	if (!i_wb_stall)
	begin

		o_wb_stb  &lt;= 1'b0;
		o_wb_addr &lt;= o_wb_addr + inc;

			o_rsp_word &lt;= `RSP_WRITE_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT;
		else
			o_rsp_word &lt;= { `RSP_SUB_DATA, i_wb_data };
	end
end</code></pre></figure>

<p>From this view, the three states of the controller should be readily
apparent.  The controller starts out idle, CYC=STB=0. 
Once the controller receives a command, it
moves to a bus request state to issue the command, CYC=STB=1.  Once the
command has been issued, but before any response, it is in a bus wait state
with CYC=1, STB=0.  When the final ACK comes back, we’ll go back to idle,
CYC=STB=0.</p>

<p>That’s how a wishbone master works.</p>

<p>When I first sketch out a design, it often looks very similar to this giant
always block above.  Perhaps it’s my software background.  I like to build
one big always block with all the parts and pieces within it.  Indeed, my
<a href="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">flash controller</a> is still built in
this fashion, with one giant always block.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve been doing this for a while, I’ve learned that breaking the
big always block up into little blocks is easier on the FPGA.  For example,
in this case, why should the address lines only get set when the new address
command shows up <em>and</em> the reset is clear?</p>

<p>For this reason, we’ll split up the always block into parts and pieces.</p>

<h3 id="the-cyc-and-stb-lines">The CYC and STB Lines</h3>

<p>The wishbone CYC and STB lines are so integrally connected, they
tend to remain together no matter how the interface gets broken up.  Indeed,
these two wires alone define which state we are in within our state space.
Further, in the big always block above, few lines actually depend upon
the reset line.  Hence, we’ll build their state diagram like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">initial	o_wb_cyc = 1'b0;
initial	o_wb_stb = 1'b0;
always @(posedge i_clk)
	if ((i_reset)||((i_wb_err)&amp;&amp;(o_wb_cyc)))
	begin
		// On any error or reset, then clear the bus.
		o_wb_cyc &lt;= 1'b0;
		o_wb_stb &lt;= 1'b0;
	end else if (o_wb_stb)
	begin
		//
		// BUS REQUEST state
		//
		if (!i_wb_stall)
			// If we are only going to do one transaction,
			// then as soon as the stall line is lowered, we are
			// done.
			o_wb_stb &lt;= 1'b0;

		// While not likely, it is possible that a slave might ACK
		// our request on the same clock it is received.  In that
		// case, drop the CYC line.
		//
		// We gate this with the stall line in case we receive an
		// ACK while our request has yet to go out.  This may make
		// more sense later, when we are sending multiple back to back
		// requests across the bus, but we'll leave this gate here
		// as a placeholder until then.
		if ((!i_wb_stall)&amp;&amp;(i_wb_ack))
			o_wb_cyc &lt;= 1'b0;
	end else if (o_wb_cyc)
	begin
		//
		// BUS WAIT
		//
		if (i_wb_ack)
			// Once the slave acknowledges our request, we are done.
			o_wb_cyc &lt;= 1'b0;
	end else begin
		//
		// IDLE state
		//
		if (i_cmd_bus)
		begin
			// We've been asked to start a bus cycle from our
			// command word, either RD or WR
			o_wb_cyc &lt;= 1'b1;
			o_wb_stb &lt;= 1'b1;
		end
	end

	// For now, we'll use the bus cycle line as an indication of whether
	// or not we are too busy to accept anything else from the command
	// port.  This will change if we want to accept multiple write
	// commands per bus cycle, but that will be a bus master that's
	// not nearly so simple.
	assign	o_cmd_busy = o_wb_cyc;</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="the-write-line">The write line</h3>
<p>We can significantly simplify the output bus write enable line.  Since we only
accept commands when we are in the idle state, and we only transition to
the bus request state on a read (or write) command, we can just simply leave
this as:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	always @(posedge i_clk)
		if (!o_wb_cyc)
			o_wb_we &lt;= (i_cmd_wr);</code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice how much we just simplified this.</p>

<p>The consequence of this simplification (and the many others like it) is that
our code will be harder to read.
The positive: because this line now uses fewer FPGA resources, there will
be less logic between clocks, allowing you to (possibly) run your clock a 
touch faster, and there will be fewer LUTs used to generate this line, allowing
you to place more of what you care about onto your FPGA.</p>

<h3 id="the-address-lines">The Address Lines</h3>

<p>We remove the address lines from the big block simply because there’s no reason
why the address line logic needs to depend upon the reset line.  On reset, we
can allow the address (and the increment) to both come up undefined.  We’ll
also keep our own internal new address variable in this block as well.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	//
	// The bus ADDRESS lines
	//
	initial	newaddr = 1'b0;
	always @(posedge i_clk)
	begin
		if ((i_cmd_addr)&amp;&amp;(!o_cmd_busy))
		begin
			// If we are in the idle state, we accept address
			// setting commands.  Specifically, we'll allow the
			// user to either set the address, or add a difference
			// to our address.  The difference may not make sense

			// down the number of bits required in a set address
			// request.
			if (!i_cmd_word[1])
				o_wb_addr &lt;= i_cmd_word[31:2];
			else
				o_wb_addr &lt;= i_cmd_word[31:2] + o_wb_addr;

			//
			// We'll allow that bus requests can either increment
			// the address, or leave it the same.  One bit in the
			// command word will tell us which, and we'll set this
			// bit on any set address command.
			inc &lt;= !i_cmd_word[0];
		end else if ((o_wb_stb)&amp;&amp;(!i_wb_stall))
			// The address lines are used while the bus is active,
			// and referenced any time STB &amp;&amp; !STALL are true.
			//
			// However, once STB and !STALL are both true, then the

			// we add our increment (one or zero) here.
			o_wb_addr &lt;= o_wb_addr + , inc};


		// We'd like to respond to the bus with any address we just

		//
		// The problem is that the add (above) when setting the address
		// takes a clock to do.  Hence, we'll use "newaddr" as a flag
		// that o_wb_addr has a new value in it that needs to be
		// returned via the command link.
		newaddr &lt;= ((i_cmd_addr)&amp;&amp;(!o_cmd_busy));
	end</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="the-output-data-lines">The output data lines</h3>

<p>Those output data lines can be set just like the write enable line.  Only,
this time, we don’t care what the lines are set to when we are reading.
Hence, we’ll set them upon any request.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	always @(posedge i_clk)
	begin
		// This may look a touch confusing ... what's important is that:
		//
		// 1. No one cares what the bus data lines are, unless we are
		//	in the middle of a write cycle.
		// 2. Even during a write cycle, these lines are don't cares
		//	if the STB line is low, indicating no more requests
		// 3. When a request is received to write, and so we transition
		//	to a bus write cycle, that request will come with data.
		// 4. Hence, we set the data words in the IDLE state on the
		//	same clock we go to BUS REQUEST.  While in BUS REQUEST,
		//	these lines cannot change until the slave has accepted
		//	our inputs.
		//
		// Thus we force these lines to be constant any time STB and
		// STALL are both true, but set them otherwise.
		//
		if ((!o_wb_stb)||(!i_wb_stall))
			o_wb_data &lt;= i_cmd_word[31:0];
	end</code></pre></figure>

<p>Since we are setting 32 outputs, the logic savings is much greater than the
savings from simplifying just the one <strong>o_wb_we</strong> line.</p>

<h3 id="the-output-result">The output result</h3>

<p>We also need to return a result back up the command chain.  This result will
be dependent upon what has taken place.  It could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An acknowledgement of a bus reset request</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A notification of a bus error</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An acknowledgement of a new address, or a value that has been written</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or (finally) the result of any data  read from the bus.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Because of all of these possibilities, it takes a bit of logic to set this
right.  Remember, <strong>o_rsp_stb</strong> will be true any time <strong>o_rsp_word</strong> has valid
information, and that the <strong>o_rsp_word</strong> wires are don’t cares any time
<strong>o_rsp_stb</strong> is low.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">always @(posedge i_clk)
	if (i_reset)
	begin
		o_rsp_stb &lt;= 1'b1;
		o_rsp_word &lt;= `RSP_RESET;
	end else if (i_wb_err)
	begin
		o_rsp_stb &lt;= 1'b1;
		o_rsp_word &lt;= `RSP_BUS_ERROR;
	end else if (o_wb_cyc) begin
		//
		// We're either in the BUS REQUEST or BUS WAIT states
		//
		// Either way, we want to return a response on our command
		// channel if anything gets ack'd
		o_rsp_stb &lt;= (i_wb_ack);
		//
		//
		if (o_wb_we)
			o_rsp_word &lt;= `RSP_WRITE_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT;
		else
			o_rsp_word &lt;= { `RSP_SUB_DATA, i_wb_data };
	end else begin
		//
		// We are in the IDLE state.
		//
		// Echo any new addresses back up the command chain
		//
		o_rsp_stb  &lt;= newaddr;
		o_rsp_word &lt;= { `RSP_SUB_ADDR, o_wb_addr, 1'b0, !inc };

<h2 id="a-not-so-simplified-wishbone-master">A Not-So Simplified Wishbone Master</h2>

<p>If you’ve along so far, you may notice we’ve left a lot of capabilities
we want in our bus master on the floor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no means for sending multiple write commands without dropping CYC
between them.  This will break our flash controller, so we’ll have to come
back and fix this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no means for reading from (or writing to) multiple consecutive
addresses in one
transaction.  That’s really useful for getting us on and off the bus
quickly.  We’ll need to come back to this later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a lot of times when the bits in our 34-bit codeword are going
unused.  For example, why transmit 34-bits to our device just to send
a reset, when only six of those 34 bits are ever used to decode a reset?
Why send a 30’bit address offset, when you are just adding it to the current
address?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we want a really good wishbone master interface that’s fully featured,
we’ll need to come back and fix these things.  For now, let’s move on to the
next piece in our command wishbone bridge.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Now that you know the basic pieces of any wishbone bus master, here’s a list
of some example wishbone bus master’s that I’ve built that you might find
worth referencing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Instruction fetch: <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/prefetch.v">one word at a
time</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/dblfetch.v">two at a
time</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pfcache.v">using a
cache</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CPU memory stage: <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/memops.v">one word at a time
time</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pipemem.v">pipelined</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/wbdmac.v">direct memory access (DMA)
controller</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/rtl/wbuexec.v">similar UART-WB
bridge</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
