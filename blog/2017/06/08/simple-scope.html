    <p>If you’ve never built your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_analyzer">logic
scope</a> to “see” what’s going
on within an FPGA, it’s not really that hard to do.  There are a couple of
steps required to do it, but not really all that more.</p>

<p>Over time, I’ve built several logic scopes–each for a different environment
that I’ve been running in.  Somewhere around rebuilding the wheel for the
third time, and for a different customer each time, I decided to build
my own–so that I could have a scope that I legally owned and controlled,
and that I could bring with me to any new FPGA job.</p>

<p>Here in this post, we’ll walk through all the steps of building a basic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_analyzer">logic scope</a>.  We’ll reserve
until later how to go about turning this scope’s results into a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump">VCD file</a>
for <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a> viewing–but only because I was
using the scope successfully for many years before I ever even discovered
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>Before we get into the Verilog code necessary to build one of these things,
let’s discuss what we want it to do.</p>

<p>We’d like three capabilities from our scope.  First, whenever something goes
wrong within our design, we’d like to be able to look back into the past and see
what happened, as in Fig. 1.</p>

<table align="center"><caption>Fig. 1: Looking back into the past</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/scope-past.svg" alt="A scope that looks back in time" width="400" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Of course, this ability to look back in time will be limited by the size of our
scope’s memory.</p>

<p>We’d also like the ability to debug an interaction that we are in the
process of designing.  For example, if you want to read from <a href="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">flash
memory</a>,
it might be valid to look at the flash data lines together with some of your
internal <a href="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">flash control</a> state.  In
this case, you would want to start capturing at the time of your read request. 
This capability would look something like Fig 2.</p>

<table align="center"><caption>Fig. 2: After the trigger</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/scope-now.svg" alt="Using a scope to see what's happening now" width="400" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Continuing the our <a href="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">flash controller</a>
example, what if you wanted to know what happened
when the flash finished its program or erase cycle?  You’d then want to know
what was happening some distance from your trigger, often a known amount of
time later in relation to the trigger.  In that case, what you want will look
something like Fig 3.</p>

<table align="center"><caption>Fig. 3: A future event</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/scope-future.svg" alt="Examining logic lines some time in the future" width="400" /></td></tr></table>

<p>We can handle all three of these needs by counting a programmable number
of clock cycles from the scope’s trigger until we stop recording (Fig 4.)</p>

<table align="center"><caption>Fig. 4: Trigger Logic</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/scope-trigger.svg" alt="How the holdoff works" width="400" /></td></tr></table>

<p>There remains one other feature we are going to need and that is that we will
need to ensure our memory is initialized before we ever stop recording.
In particular, you really don’t want to find yourself chasing some “bug” in
your design, something that doesn’t make any sense, only to find out later
that the data you were reading from the scope wasn’t valid.  For this
reason, we need make sure all of the scope’s memory is initialized before it can
be triggered.</p>

<p>This leads to the rough timing diagram shown in Fig 5.</p>

<table><caption>Fig. 5: Scope timing</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/simple-scope.svg" alt="The stages of a scope's capture" width="800" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In particular, following any scope reset, we’ll insist on setting all of the
values in memory before permitting the scope to be triggered.</p>

<p>Okay, now that we know what we want to do, let’s look into how to do it.</p>

<h2 id="filling-the-scope">Filling the scope</h2>

<p>The first step to building a scope is to load your data into the scope.  There
are two parts to this.  The first is keeping track of the address you are
writing within your block RAM, and the second part is actually writing to that
memory.  Both parts are quite simple.</p>

<p>We’ll use a register, <strong>waddr</strong> to contain the address we wish to write to.
We’ll insist that this address start at zero only so we can tell if the
scope’s memory was ever fully initialized.  This address will quietly wrap
around the limits of the memory, whatever those limits might be, as we write.
We’ll also increment this address every time we receive a valid data sample
until the scope stops.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">waddr</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">stopped</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">waddr</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">waddr</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Writing to memory is even simpler: On any clock when we’ve got valid data,
we write to the scope’s memory–up until the point where we stop the scope.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">stopped</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">waddr</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">i_data</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’ve never used block RAM within an FPGA before, the various synthesis
tools can be finicky.  In general, if you have too much logic within the same
always block as the memory write, they won’t recognize the block RAM.  That’s
why we keep our memory write logic <em>simple</em>.  (Ref
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp231.pdf">[1]</a>)</p>

<p>We also write to our memory on every clock up until we are stopped.  This is
how we guarantee that, when we get a trigger, we can have a valid capture of
whatever it was that lead up to the trigger.</p>

<p>The final piece to our scope’s write logic is the detection of when the scope
was filled.  Since we started the write address at zero, we’ll know we have
filled the scope on the same clock that we both write to it, and write to it
with the address equal to all ones.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">primed</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">primed</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">primed</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">waddr</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With this simple logic, you’ve now created your first
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_analyzer">scope</a>.  Now let’s look
at how to stop it, and then how to get the results out of it.</p>

<h2 id="triggering-the-scope">Triggering the scope</h2>

<p>A quick examination of Fig. 4 above should make plain what we wish to do.</p>

<p>First, from reset until we’ve been triggered, the scope runs and records
normally.  Once we receive a trigger, and only then, do we move on to the
next step.  Hence, we need to know when we’ve been triggered.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">triggered</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i_trigger</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">primed</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">triggered</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You might notice that this trigger doesn’t depend upon <strong>i_ce</strong>, even though
all of the data reads and writes do.  This was done on purpose so that
any trigger that takes place between <strong>i_ce</strong>’s will still get noticed by
the scope.</p>

<p>The next step is to count some programmable number of clocks from the trigger
until we stop.  We’ll call this counter the <strong>holdoff_counter</strong>, and
we’ll start it counting as soon as we are triggered.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_ck</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">||</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">triggered</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">holdoff_counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">holdoff_counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">holdoff_counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Once the holdoff counter reaches the user holdoff, we then set a flag to
indicate we have stopped.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_ck</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">||</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">triggered</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">stopped</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">stopped</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">stopped</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">holdoff_counter</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">user_holdoff</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The only tricky part about all of these controls is lining them all up so that
the last data sample is the sample that produced the trigger.  For now, we’ll
leave as an exercise for the student.</p>

<p>The last step will be to read the results out of your local
<a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">wishbone bus</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reading-the-results">Reading the results</h2>

<p>When it comes to reading results, there are just a couple of tricks required. 
Most of these are involved with unwrapping the RAM memory, and the rest of
what is required is straight forward.</p>

<p>Remember how we just wrote to successive memory locations until we stopped?
We’re going to need to unwrap all of that.</p>

<p>The first step is to calculate the offset we need into the memory array.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">raddr</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i_wb_stb</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_wb_we</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_wb_addr</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">raddr</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">raddr</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ll then add this offset to the write address to get the address we need from
the scope’s memory.  The trick is that this operation has now taken an
extra clock.  If we want to support a throughput of one read per bus clock,
we’re going to need to add one extra unit to keep up with the bus clock.
In other words, we’ll pre-compute the next read address if we are in the middle
of a read, but otherwise have only the offset plus the last write address.</p>

<p>Will this address calculation wrap around the end of the memory back to the
beginning?  Most definitely.  We are counting upon that.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i_wb_stb</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_wb_we</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_wb_addr</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">this_addr</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">raddr</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">waddr</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span>
		<span class="n">this_addr</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">raddr</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">waddr</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we have our read address, referenced from the beginning of memory
rather than from the beginning of of the capture we are reporting, we can
now read from the scope’s memory.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">this_addr</span><span class="p">];</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you examine this, remember that block RAM logic is special, whether read or
write–it must
fit the form of what the synthesizer is expecting, or the memory will be
implemented in logic instead of RAM.  It is for that reason that we keep our
memory read as simple as possible and don’t try to merge it with the
output case statement below.</p>

<p>The final step is to place this value onto the bus.  We hold onto our address
for one clock, so that we can align our data read with the bus request, and
make certain that we are always returning the right value on the right clock.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">last_bus_addr</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">i_wb_addr</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We do the same thing for our acknowledgement line, delaying it for one clock,
to give us time to actually read from the bus.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">o_wb_ack</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
	<span class="n">pre_ack</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">i_wb_stb</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">o_wb_ack</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
	<span class="n">o_wb_ack</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">pre_ack</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Otherwise reading from this scope is just as simple as reading from any
address from any other simple peripheral.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">case</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">last_bus_addr</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">o_wb_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">stopped</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">triggered</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">,</span>
			<span class="mh">3'h0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">LGMEMLEN</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">user_holdoff</span> <span class="o">}</span><span class="p">;</span>

	<span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">o_wb_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">endcase</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it!  There’s not all that much to it.  A scope requires writing to
memory, stopping based upon some trigger, and then reading the data back
out later.  You’ve now seen all of these pieces.</p>

<p>Now that you know how one of these scopes works, and even better how to build
your own, you might wish to check out my own version of a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone
scope</a> or even its <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/axilscope.v">AXI-lite
equivalent</a>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of differences between my own <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone
scope</a>, the one I call
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/wbscope">wbscope</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">found on GitHub</a>,
and the scope we’ve just outlined above, although not that many.  Here’s a
quick list of differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wbscope</a> allows you to use two
asynchronous clocks, if you need them: one for the data and another
for the bus.</p>

    <p>I needed this capability when testing the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/enetpackets.v">RMII ethernet
controller</a>
within the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty project</a> for the
<a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/arty-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists">Arty board</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data capture within our <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a>
has been carefully calibrated so that a hold off of zero will place the
trigger in exactly the last location in memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a> in the repo adds
a couple extra bus directed capabilities.  These include</p>

    <p>o an interrupt output for an on-board CPU,</p>

    <p>o the ability to manually disable the scope’s trigger, or even</p>

    <p>o the ability to manually trigger the scope from the bus independent of the
  trigger wired into the scope.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve also built a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/wbscopc.v">compressed version of the
scope</a> that
applies
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">run length encoding</a>
to the data, to allow recording events over a long period of time.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Further, there’s even a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/axilscope.v">AXI-lite version of the
scope</a>, although
since I don’t use the AXI bus, that version has not been tested very much–so
I can’t assure you that it works.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>We’ll still queue up for later how to actually create a
<a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">wishbone bus master</a> that can
be commanded from from a local host PC, as well as instructions for how to
turn these results into a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump">VCD file</a>
that you can view with <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>.</p>
