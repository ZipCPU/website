    <p>Many individuals have read my previous posts and have wondered what my debugging
philosophy actually is.  They’ve asked me how I would recommend debugging
a design.  This post attempts to outline the general approaches
I used to debug <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU">my own FPGA designs</a>.</p>

<p>In quick sum:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Simulation</strong>: I recommend using a simulator that allows allows you to
simulate all of the external components of your design in a fully
integrated fashion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hardware testing</strong>: I recommend including some form of
integrated logic analyzer or scope within your design when you move
into hardware.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>While I tend to use open source products, I have nothing against commercial
products that will help a designer accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>That said, let’s take a look at my own debugging philosophy in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>

<p>Because implementing logic on an FPGA can take so long to do, I am a firm
believer in using a simulation.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1: Simulation</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/dbg-by-sim.svg" alt="Parts of Debugging an FPGA via Simulation" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>FPGA’s often need to communicate with external devices, though, and those
external devices need to respond to the simulated logic and the test designer
as though they were present in hardware.</p>

<p>I recommend, therefore, for those components of an FPGA design that need to
interact with an external device, that the simulation facility provide an
external component simulator and interface validator <em>for each external
component</em> the digital logic needs to interact with.  By component simulator,
I mean something that creates inputs and treats outputs like the real hardware
component would.  By interface validator, I mean something that will quickly
draw the developer’s attention to any violations in the interface protocol.</p>

<p>This means that the minimum capability I would require of any simulation
capability is the ability to simulate <em>all</em> of the external components on my design.
Were this a commercial capability, I would want to be able to integrate
my own external component simulations as well as any external component
simulations produced by multiple (possibly competing) vendors.</p>

<table style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 2: Integrated Simulation</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/dbg-by-integrated-sim.svg" alt="Integrating Sim Components into a Fullblown Simulator" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This minimum capability would allow me to simulate my entire, integrated design,
as shown in Fig 2.  That is, I should be able to integrate all of these
component simulators into an integrated design simulation.</p>

<p>Does your design have a <em>UART</em> within it?  Your simulation should then be able
to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/bench/cpp/uartsim.cpp">simulate a
UART</a>. 
Your design should be able to create a UART waveform, and your external
component simulator should be able to process it and perhaps place the result
on your simulation terminal.  You should be able to type into that simulation
terminal anything and have it sent to your external UART simulator. 
The external component simulator should then translate anything it reads, and
send it into your design as a proper UART signal.</p>

<p>Does your design have a flash component within it?  You should be able to start
up, erase, program, and read from that flash as a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sim/verilated/qspiflashsim.cpp">part of your
simulation</a>.</p>

<p>Does your design include <em>buttons or switches</em>?  You should be able to simulate
buttons and switches, and your simulations should be good enough to test any
debouncing capability you might have.</p>

<p>Does your design have an <em>SD card</em> within it?  You should be able to
communicate with the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi/blob/master/bench/cpp/sdspisim.cpp">simulated SD card</a>, and even have a simulation that can match the
SD card you wish to use in your design.</p>

<p>Does your design have a <em>VGA</em> within it?  Your simulation should then be able
decode your VGA output, to prove that you are producing the correct
synchronization signals, and then to draw the pixels to the screen in a way
that you can verify that your VGA code works.  You can find an example of
what I’m talking about <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">here</a>.</p>

<p>Does your design have an <em>EDID component</em> to it?  Your simulator should <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c/blob/master/bench/cpp/i2csim.cpp">be
able to communicate EDID
information</a>
to your design over a proper I2C port.</p>

<p>Does your design have <em>(DDRx) SDRAM</em> within it?  Your simulator should be able
to match the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/sim/verilated/memsim.cpp">SDRAM’s
capability</a> in a clock for clock fashion.  You might even wish to
debug any <a href="http://opencores.org/project,wbddr3">DDR3 SDRAM in detail</a>.</p>

<p>Does your design have a <em>CPU</em> within it?  Your simulator should be able to
simulate the CPU, it’s booting process (using flash, if that’s what you have),
and it should allow you to see what’s going inside the CPU as it boots.
You should be able to trace the instructions your CPU executes, together with
any logic used within your design.
Do you want to be able to run a program on your CPU?  You should be able to
do that within the CPU, and it should be able to interact with its environment
in a manner similar to its real environment.</p>

<p>This is my philosophy on simulation.</p>

<p>As you can see, I am a firm believer in simulating your <em>whole design</em>, not
just the components.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator/">Verilator</a> meets these requirements.
Do you know of any other capability that can?  Please feel free to comment
about it in the discussion at the end of this post.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-testing">Hardware Testing</h2>

<p>I’m also not so naive as to believe that a design will work the first time it’s
placed in an actual FPGA.  For this reason, I am a firm believer in testing
on the actual hardware as well.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3: Hardware in the Loop Testing</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/dbg-by-hitl.svg" alt="Parts of Debugging an FPGA via Simulation" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Hardware testing includes both component testing (externally
directed, often without the CPU), as well as integrated design testing.</p>

<p>Using your hardware, you should be able to test components by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Issuing individual commands to them, and verifying that individual
interactions work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then issuing more complex strings of commands</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In both cases, you should be able to start from a (roughly) known condition,
command the hardware to begin the test, and then be able to measure the
results of the test.  Doing this necessitates some form of internal logic
analyzer, such as the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a> that
I use.</p>

<p>I like to issue commands over some form of debugging bus, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus/rtl">hexbus debugging bus</a>
we’ve <a href="/topics.html">just built together</a>.  This allows me
to command various tests, and to read information and status back out of the
FPGA.  If you have a CPU on board, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>, you may wish to
command your tests in a faster and more coordinated fashion from software.</p>

<p>Trace data itself can be drawn from something as simple as your own
<a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">user designed scope</a>, or
<a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist Technology</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a>.  We’ll be discussing
in the near future how you can add the capability to create a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump">VCD</a> file to your scope.
That will finish off the discussion on how to build your own debugging
facility.</p>

<p>Commercial products exist that can record trace information from within your
chip.  <a href="https://xilinx.com">Xilinx</a>, for example, includes their
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/ila/v6_2/pg172-ila.pdf">Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA)</a>
as part of the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado Design
Suite</a>.
You’ll <a href="https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Installation-and-Licensing/WebPACK-and-ILA/td-p/558110">need more than the free webpack
license</a>,
though, in order to use it.  Given how easy such an analyzer is to build,
it’s probably not work the $3k necessary to pay for a full
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Design Suite</a>
license just to use this capability.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of rolling your own, is that integrating your own logic
analyzer into your own logic can be done with your favorite interface.
For example, I’ve often used the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> to trigger the scope or to examine
the outputs of it.  Further, unlike a commercial scope which may be restricted
to using the JTAG for control and output, I can get the outputs via whatever
debugging bus I’m already using.</p>

<h2 id="your-own-choices">Your own choices</h2>

<p>These two components outline the philosophy I use to debug my own FPGA
designs.</p>

<p>I am a firm believer in simulation.</p>

<p>I grew up testing on the hardware itself, and see no problems with it <em>as long
as you can get an internal trace from your hardware</em>.</p>

<p>Do you have a different debugging philosophy?  Do you know of other or better
tools?  Feel free to post and discuss them below.</p>
