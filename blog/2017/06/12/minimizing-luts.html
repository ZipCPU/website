  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There have now been several projects I’ve worked on where I’ve butted up
against the maximum resource utilization of an FPGA chip.  If you ask a
manager how to deal with this problem, they will think you need a bigger FPGA.
This answer is problematic, though, for two primary reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you already have your board designed, built, and tested–perhaps even in
production, and you wish to add features to the board, you will be stuck
with the FPGA resources that you already have.  Building or even just
assembling a new board with a bigger FPGA can be an expensive proposition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m a hobbyist.  I typically can’t afford a bigger FPGA</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At times like these, a thorough code scrubbing can often help you squeak that
last Lookup-Table (LUT) out of your FPGA.  To do that, I’ve come up with
several strategies for reducing my LUT count on an FPGA.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-lut">What is a LUT?</h2>

<p>A LUT is a Look-Up Table.  Modern FPGA’s are built out of
large arrays of these lookup tables.  Using a lookup table, you can build
any logic you want–so long as you don’t exceed the number of elements in the
lookup table.</p>

<p>As an example, the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug474_7Series_CLB.pdf">7-series Xilinx FPGAs</a> are composed of
“configurable logic blocks”, each of which contain two “slices”, of
which each of those “slices” contain four 6-input LUTs.  Each of these
LUT’s can handle either one six input lookup, or two five input lookups–as
long as the two share the same inputs.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/hb/cyclone-iv/cyciv-51002.pdf">Altera Cyclone IV</a>,
on the other hand, has only 4-input LUTs.</p>

<p>The point being that every FPGA implements your logic via a combination of
LUTs.</p>

<p>Chips differ by the capability of their LUTs, as well as by the number of LUTs
on board.  In general, the more LUTs you have, the more logic your chip can do,
but also the more your FPGA chip is going to cost.  It’s all a tradeoff.</p>

<p>To get the most logic for a given price, the FPGA design engineer needs to be
able to code efficiently, and pack their code into the fewest LUTs possible.</p>

<h2 id="the-zipcpu-and-the-s6soc">The ZipCPU and the S6SoC</h2>

<p>When the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> was first built, it only
supported 32-bit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>.  This meant that the smallest
unit of individually addressable memory was the full bus size: 32-bits. 
This has all kinds of consequences when you wish to operate on 8-bit values,
or when computer code depends upon 4*sizeof(char)==sizeof(int).</p>

<p>In my case, the light dawned when I realized that I would need to rewrite the 
entire <a href="https://sourceware.org/newlib">C-library</a> to support 32-bit bytes, that
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone">Dhrystone benchmark</a> depended upon
8-bit bytes (<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/doc/orconf.pdf">Ref</a>),
that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">Coremark</a> also depended upon
8-bit bytes.  Figuring that this was only the tip of the iceberg regarding the
problems I was going to have, I then decided to <em>byte</em> the bullet and add
byte-wise addressing instructions to the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>.</p>

<p>The problem with this was that the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>
already worked and worked well on some very small FPGA’s, and the
Spartan 6/LX4 on the
<a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod S6</a> was
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">one of them</a>.
With only 2400 six-input LUTs to work with in total, and only about 50 to
spare, could
the additional logic necessary to fit the new instructions fit onto the
<a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">S6</a>?</p>

<p>I actually set my goals higher.  Not only did I want the new instructions to
fit, but I wanted to make some other upgrades as well.  Most of these other
upgrades surrounded the slow flash speed.  Because the S6/LX4 has hardly
any RAM, almost all of the instructions had to fit within the flash.  Flash
access, however, is <em>slow</em>.  Hence, when I started my upgrades, the ZipCPU
took 52 clocks per instruction when running from the flash.  Ouch!  Could
something be done about this as well?</p>

<p>So these were my goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The obvious: I wanted to be able to support the extra 8-bit byte instructions:
LH (load halfword), SH (store halfword), LB (load byte), and SB (store byte).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wanted to upgrade the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</a>
to be able to use the compressed instruction
set extension of the ZipCPU.  Using that extension, the assembler can
(sometimes) pack two instructions into one instruction word.  If the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</a> could be made to handle these
instructions, then I wouldn’t need to compile two versions of the C-library:
one using and one without using these instructions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to upgrade the fetch routine, so that it could handle fetching two
words at a time.</p>

    <p>Because of the way the QSPI flash is set up, the first word you fetch from
flash
will always cost 22 flash clocks.  The first six of those are for the address,
the next 8 to allow the flash to look up your address, and then another
eight to read the data back out.  Since I was generating a clock signal from
logic, the flash actually ran at half that speed, costing me 
44 clocks every time I wished to fetch an instruction.  At the time, the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</a> had absolutely no pipelining,
so it was always fetching a new instruction after executing every instruction.</p>

    <p>If I could fetch two instructions at a time, that would
cost only 60 clocks, and yet provide me with two instruction words.
This should raise the instruction speed from one instruction every 52 clocks
to one instruction every 38 clocks or so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to update the flash controller so that it would work off of a
80MHz flash clock instead of a 40MHz flash clock.  Basically, I wanted to
run the flash at the speed of the rest of the FPGA.  Since the flash was
rated for 100MHz, this shouldn’t be a problem, right?</p>

    <p>This should reduce the number of clocks necessary to load two instructions
from 60 clocks to 30, speeding the instruction issue rate up to about one
instruction every 2 clocks.</p>

    <p>In the end, supporting the compressed instructions got me down to one
instruction every 18 clocks, but I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the update went along, things went so well I started to get greedy.  So, I
added more goals to my upgrade:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Now, I wanted to add the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/div.v">divide
unit</a> into the
design</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/cpuops.v">full
multiply</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wanted to partially pipeline <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/zipcpu.v">the CPU
itself</a>.  I
still wanted to avoid the
expensive collision detection logic, but partially pipelining the CPU would
speed the CPU up another 60% (5 clocks per ALU instruction down to 3)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, I got everything I wanted save the LOCK instruction.  (The LOCK
instruction holds the bus cycle line high while reading a value, running one
ALU operation on it, and then writing the value back.  It’s also useful
for atomically reading 64-bit values.)</p>

<h2 id="strategies-to-reduce-logic-usage">Strategies to Reduce Logic Usage</h2>

<p>Here’s how I managed to fit so many upgrades into 2400 LUTs, given that I was
already using 2345 of them.  (Yes, that’s right, on a device with 2400 LUTs,
I managed to use <em>all</em> of them.)</p>

<p>Here are some of the strategies I’ve used over time to keep my LUT usage
down:</p>

<h3 id="start-by-counting-your-logic">Start by counting your logic.</h3>

<p>Your design tools should be able to tell you how many LUTs you are using.
Some tools will even break this out nicely between design modules, helping
you to focus on the part that needs work.</p>

<p>Find out how to do this, and then track your work throughout your design.</p>

<p>While one strategy is to set your sites on the biggest components, I also
got a lot of savings by looking at how many LUTs were consumed by the smaller
components as well.  When you are starting out at 2345 LUTs out of 2400,
<em>every LUT matters</em>.</p>

<p>Now, understand that the synthesizer is going to try to map all of your logic
into LUTs.  Every LUT can handle some number of inputs.  Look up what your
hardware’s definition of a LUT is, and then <em>count</em> the number of
inputs to every flip-flop in your design.  Count the number of wires to
each flip-flop enable, and the number of alternatives within every block. 
Work to bring that number down to eight or less if possible, and you’ll be
amazed at how well your design will handle both fitting onto your device,
as well as the speed of the logic you can achieve using your logic.</p>

<p>So, for some simple numbers to think about with respect to <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug474_7Series_CLB.pdf">Xilinx’s CLB
structure</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>5 inputs: If you can get your logic down to five inputs or less, you might
be able to share a LUT with wires within a group</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6 inputs: Anything that requires six inputs will require one LUT.  Be aware
of busses of logic all requiring 6-inputs … you are likely to need one
LUT for every input in that bus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7 inputs: Requires two LUTs and a 7-Mux.  This still fits within one slice,
so it doesn’t impact your timing (much) yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>8 inputs: Requires four LUTs and n 8-input mux.  This still fits within 
one slice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>9 inputs and more: These don’t fit nicely into a LUT, nor do they fit nicely
into a set of four LUTs, and so the synthesis
tool is going to have to try to figure out how to string LUTs together to
accomplish your logic.  If your logic isn’t an add, subtract, or compare
that can use the carry chain, you may wish to do your best to avoid this
amount of logic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you go through your logic: <em>force every LUT to justify its existence</em>.</p>

<h3 id="use-block-ram-anywhere-you-can">Use block RAM anywhere you can.</h3>

<p>Look for memories that are implemented in LUTs, and turn them into block RAMs.
Anywhere you can do this will yield an <em>amazing</em> savings.
Indeed, switching from LUTs to block RAM has often been the difference between
failure and success in my designs.</p>

<p>For example, the following logic isn’t likely to make it into block RAM:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">addrA</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">valA</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">B</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">addrB</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">valB</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>However, with a couple simple manipulations, you can often trade a clock of
delay for the capability you need.  The following, for example, will fit in
Block RAM:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="c1">// Capture the logic we need ...</span>

<p>This was an important part of getting my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SD-SPI</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/enetpackets.v">RMII ethernet</a>
modules to work, although it didn’t help the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</a> in particular.  Still, it allowed
me to run the SD-SPI controller with a 200MHz clock – so lowering your LUT
usage is likely to increase your maximum speed as well.</p>

<h3 id="be-very-aware-of-nested-ifs">Be very aware of nested if’s</h3>

<p>My first attempt at any design tends to look like a giant if-then-else logic
block handling states and state transitions.  They’re just too easy to
understand and follow.  As an example, the <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-wb-master.html">simple wishbone
master</a>
controller we built the other day started
with a giant always block with several conditions.</p>

<p>The problem with these large logic blocks is that there are often states where
you don’t care what certain values are for some variables.  In these cases,
you can simplify the logic for those states.</p>

<p>For example, imagine something like ….</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">RESET</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">begin</span>
	<span class="n">valid</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">/// Really a don't care</span>
<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CE</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">begin</span>
	<span class="n">valid</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">input</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">valid</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(...</span> <span class="n">something</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s count this logic:  Each of the bits in valid and B depend upon both RESET
and CE, hence a minimum of one LUT each.  Further, the flip-flop clock enable
line also requires a LUT for each flip flop.  So, we’re talking about 2 LUTs
for the valid signal, and another 2 LUTs <em>for every bit in B</em>.</p>

<p>If the only value that really depends upon the RESET is the valid signal,
which indicates whether or not B contains a valid value, why must B be set
on reset?  In this case, you want to separate your logic into multiple logic
blocks, often one block per variable.  You can then end up with something
like …</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">RESET</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">valid</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CE</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">valid</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">input</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">valid</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">CE</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(...</span> <span class="n">something</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If CE is a simple wire by itself, and not composed of more logic resources,
than it won’t cost any LUTs to calculate.  Likewise if the value you wish to
store in B comes from already calculated logic on your board, then you have
just spared yourself one LUT for every wire in B.  Even if there are several
inputs to the wires in B, if you just managed to drop from 6-inputs to five
for each wire, then you may have dropped the number of LUTs used to calculate
B in half.</p>

<p>The impact of this can be significant.</p>

<p>Two examples of updated and simplified logic would be my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/rtl/qflashxpress.v">simplified QSPI
flash controller</a> when
compared with the giant always block in <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/rtl/wbqspiflash.v">basic flash

Even though the simplified controller can only handle read requests,
its amazingly light on the logic.</p>

<p>Likewise, my recent rewrite of my 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/txuart.v">transmitter</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/rxuart.v">receiver</a>
saved me many LUTs by breaking up the logic in that big always block.
Perhaps you might enjoy looking through the
GIT history of this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART controller</a>,
to see how easy they were to read <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/commit/e157c6e110e84f418514c7617db80519f5bba6ca">back when they used a massive state
transition block</a>, and then to compare that with what they look like today.</p>

<h3 id="reduce-your-requirements-if-you-can">Reduce your requirements if you can</h3>

<p>Very few UART controllers truly need to handle 5, 6, and 7-bit words, parity,
break setting and detection, parity error and frame error detection, hardware
flow control, and so forth.  If you know your application well, and
you have code in your application that is designed to handle things that will
never happen, then <em>remove that code</em>.</p>

<p>In my case, the 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/txuart.v">transmitter</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/rxuart.v">receiver</a>
had way more functionality than I needed.  So, I built a lighter UART
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/txuartlite.v">transmitter</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/rxuartlite.v">receiver</a>
with only the capabilities I would ever use.
Since I had long since removed the UART
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/ufifo.v">FIFO</a>,
there wasn’t much more I could after that.</p>

<p>The point being, if you’ve over designed your product–remove the
all that extra, unused, logic when you get tight on resources.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-bit-selects-if-you-can">Avoid bit selects if you can</h3>

<p>I made a lot of adjustments to the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/rtl/cpu/div.v">divide unit</a>
to get it to fit.  Most of these adjustments followed the advice above,
but one very powerful adjustment was also to get rid of a statement like …</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lots_of_conditions</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">o_quotient</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">current_bit</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">logic</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">calculate</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="kt">bit</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and, with some understanding that every bit needed to be set anyway, I was
able to rearrange that statement into,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lots</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">conditions</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">o_quotient</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">o_quotient</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">logic</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">calculate</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="kt">bit</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">}</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Think about the LUT usage required to implement this statement.  The first
statement requires
many LUTs <em>per bit</em> to determine not only whether that bit is going to be set,
but also what the bit will be set to.  The second example still requires some
LUTs to determine whether or not <em>a</em> bit is going to be set, but those LUTs
can be shared across all bits.  Further, only the bottom bit has to have the
special set of LUTs to determine what the bit needs to be set to.</p>

<p>That one optimization by itself saved me many, many LUTs.  In the end, I think
I saved about 100 LUTs out of a 300 LUT component, but you can look at the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/commits/master/rtl/cpu/div.v">git log</a> to see
the details of the other changes that were made along the way.</p>

<h3 id="manage-your-reset-logic">Manage your Reset Logic</h3>

<p>If you follow <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp272.pdf">Xilinx’s
 guidance</a>,
they would highly recommend against having
a global reset.  They explain pretty clearly how it impedes all of the logic
within your design.</p>

<p>In my own implementations, such as within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/zipcpu.v">ZipCPU</a>, I
tend to create _valid lines stating whether or not a group of logic lines
is actually valid.  These lines then get the reset signal, while all the other
logic ignores it.  Indeed, many of my
<a href="/projects.html">ZipCPU implementations </a>
don’t use a global (or even a local) reset at all.  Sure, the CPU has
a reset line … but I usually leave it unconnected, and instead command the
reset from some amount of local logic.  For example, both the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/wbwatchdog.v">watchdog timer</a>
and the debug port can command a reset.  Further, on a really small design
with no debug port (i.e., the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC again</a>),
I used a button for that purpose.</p>

<h3 id="application-specific-optimizations">Application Specific Optimizations</h3>

<p>Some optimizations, though, are by nature application specific.  A good
example of this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response">FIR
filter</a>
I built some time ago in support of my
<a href="/projects.html">universal resampling project</a>.  (Any
rate in, to any lower rate out, out of band rejection greater than 70 dB, etc.)
When building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response">the FIR</a>,
I couldn’t afford to use block RAM’s to hold the coefficients—cause there was
no time for a RAM lookup: every coefficient needed to be used on every clock. 
The entire design, though, needed to run at the full clock rate.</p>

<p>So, I made each tap settable from a single address that would push
them all through memory–like a giant shift register.  Still, this was too
much logic.</p>

<p>In the end, even that wasn’t enough: I had to go farther so as to fix the
FIR taps with constant values within the filter.  Because of the nature
and structure of the resampling problem, this approach worked.</p>

<p>I then managed to reduce the logic required even further by forcing the filter
to be symmetric.  Indeed, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks-McClellan_filter_design_algorithm">Parks-McClellan filter design
algorithm</a>,
used for designing my lowpass anti-aliasing filters, <em>only</em> designs
such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_phase">linear phase</a> (i.e. symmetric)
filters anyway.  Thus, with this trick, I was able to use half as many
hardware multiplies.</p>

<p>Looking over my taps, I then realized I could do more since some of the taps
were zero, some had only only one bit set in their coefficient, and since the
mid-point was already scaled to (2^N-1) so as to be able to use a subtract
instead of a multiply.</p>

<p>If DSP usage is an issue, you might wish to consider this approach.</p>

<h3 id="keep-large-comparisons-out-of-state-transition-logic">Keep large comparisons out of state transition logic</h3>

<p>Don’t place large comparisons in your state transition diagrams if you
don’t need to.</p>

<p>As an example, the logic below compares A against a 32-bit value, <em>and</em>
C against a 24-bit value.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">B</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we are smart about things, we can move the comparison one clock earlier
and calculate intermediate values.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>These two intermediate values then relieve the stress on the set for the
value of B,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">B</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This was another technique that I used when simplifying the onboard
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART</a>.
To see how it works, look at the baud counter logic within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/rxuartlite.v">receiver</a>,
and pay attention to the <strong>zero_baud_counter</strong> logic.  At one time, the
state diagram had depended upon tests for whether or not
<strong>baud_counter</strong> was zero.  You can see from the 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/rxuartlite.v">receiver</a>
source how not only was the <strong>baud_counter</strong> logic removed from the main
always loop, but the <strong>zero_baud_counter</strong> logic was removed as well.
Now, the main loop only references the <strong>zero_baud_counter</strong> logic
strobe to know when to step the logic forward by one.</p>

<h3 id="if-all-else-fails-ask-for-help">If all else fails, ask for help</h3>

<p>Finally, if all else fails, ask  someone with more experience to look over
your code.  Perhaps they might see something you are missing?</p>

<p>On second thought … maybe not.  They might tell me that the way I format my
code is all wrong.</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-changes">Testing the changes</h2>

<p>Since one focus of this blog is on testing and debugging, how did I manage to
prove that these new changes worked?</p>

<p>First, all of these changes were tested initially within a simulation. 
My favorite simulation test was to see if I could get the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</a> to
run all the way from boot up to sending <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/wlibc/hello.c">Hello
World</a>
out the serial port.</p>

<p>Second, the new instruction set also included special NOOP encodings.  These
allow me to place NOOPs into the code that will then cause the simulator
to print to the screen, whether it be characters, strings, register values,
or a full register dump.  The same code, when run within the hardware, would
just ignore these NOOP instructions.  These allowed me, when using the
simulator, to “debug by printf” all over the place.</p>

<p>Third, the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sim/verilator/zip_sim.cpp">simulator</a>
also printed out a lot of trace information.  This was useful for tracing back
memory values that hadn’t been set appropriately all the way back to when they
were set.  Further, by matching the trace timing with
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKwave</a>’s timing, I was able to look up,
using <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKwave</a>,
any values that weren’t printed in the trace to find the problem.</p>

<p>Finally, for the bugs the first two items didn’t catch, I did have a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a> on board.  Since I didn’t
have room on board for my favorite debug interface, I set the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">CPU</a> up so that
on any reset (button press) it would <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/dev/resetdump.s">dump the
values</a> of the
scope and the register values on startup (these weren’t cleared on reset). 
While the result is that the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sw/wlibc/hello.c">Hello World</a>
program’s output doesn’t start
out looking pretty, I can also use that startup output to find whatever caused
the CPU to halt and need to be restarted manually.</p>

<p>So, it was all doable and straight forward.  Indeed, even today, if you don’t
have the
<a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod S6</a>,
you can still test how the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</a> would run
on that
<a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod S6</a>
by using <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/sim/verilator/zip_sim.cpp">the simulator</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-it-work">How did it work?</h2>

<p>The changes outlined above were the difference between success and failure,
between getting the updated <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</a>
working with the new instruction set
<em>and the compressed instruction extension</em>, or being able to abandon that
hardware (and my bragging rights) entirely.  Had I not made the optimizations
above, I might never have gotten the CPU to work with 8-bit bytes, and hence
I might’ve never had C-library support.  Now, however, not only does the CPU
run with 8-bit byte support, but it also has a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/div.v">divide
unit</a>, and runs 3x
faster than it ever did before.</p>

<p>What does all this mean?  If I disable illegal instruction detection for the
LOCK instruction, then I can play <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/tttt">4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe</a> on my <a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod
S6</a>.</p>

<p>So is minimizing LUT usage important?</p>

<p>Tell me your experiences!</p>
