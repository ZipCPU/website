    <p>As I’ve been watching students and others request help on the <a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">Digilent
Forums</a>, it has become apparent to me that
there’s quite a difference between the design process college students are using
and the one reality has driven me to.</p>

<p>Perhaps pointing this out will serve as a warning to the young FPGA engineer
to start their task early, and to not underestimate the amount of work
required.</p>

<h2 id="the-students-fpga-design-process">The Student’s FPGA Design Process</h2>

<p>Most of the student’s I’ve seen on the forum show up about a week before
their project is due.  They want to get things done quickly, and they want
to take the fastest path they can take to get to the goal. 
Indeed, they are following the design process shown in Fig. 1.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Figure 1: The Student</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/student-design-process.svg" alt="Student FPGA Design Process Figure" width="140" /></td></tr></table>

<ol>
  <li>The student builds his design in Verilog</li>
  <li>He then implements it on an FPGA, adjusting his design as necessary to meet
timing and build requirements</li>
  <li>The design is then placed onto the FPGA for a test, and …</li>
  <li>The student can’t figure out why it isn’t working.</li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps these students are coming from the software world.  When I program
software, I can usually debug a program using the “debug by printf” method.
If things get difficult, moving to the debugger is easy.  Either way, at any
point in my program, I can look at and examine any variable at any time and
understand what is going on within it.</p>

<p>If you expect to do this with hardware, and particularly with FPGA’s, you are
going to end up with the other students in your class at the end of the semester
wondering what happened.  You just don’t get that much visibility into an FPGA
design.</p>

<p>Plan for it.</p>

<h2 id="the-experts-design-process">The Expert’s Design Process</h2>

<p>Now, if you instead turn around and ask an expert about their design process,
they will discuss something like Fig. 2 with you.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Figure 2: The Expert</caption><tr><td><img width="240" src="/img/expert-design-process.svg" alt="The Expert's FPGA Design Process Figure" /></td></tr></table>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you don’t have an instructor, you have to find the specifications for
whatever chip you are going to work with.  This applies to both the FPGA’s
you work with, as well as any peripherals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you think you understand how the device you wish to interface with
works, you’ll build your design to interface with that device.</p>

    <p>I make
a particular point at this stage in my design process to document, at the
top of any Verilog files I build, how that Verilog file is going to connect
to the rest of any design.  While all of my files tend to use the
<a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone Bus</a>,
I still need to define the various registers on that bus, as well
as what each of the bits within those registers means, whether the registers
are read/write, etc.</p>

    <p>As I build my design, these become my notes and
reference.  I keep them up to date–especially before any spec sheet is ever
written.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next step is to build a simulator for the device.  This will allow your
simulated logic to think it is talking to the actual device.</p>

    <p>Have I skipped this step before?  Absolutely!  What was the result?  I’ve
almost always had to come back, retrace my steps, and build this simulator.
(I’m currently needing to do that with an HDMI interface I’m building.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have your logic, and a simulator in place, you can now build a test
bench that will exercise your logic against the simulator and see whether
or not your logic works.</p>

    <p>Have I skipped this step before?  You bet!  The result?  I just got burned
this last week.</p>

    <p>The story has to do with a <a href="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">flash
controller</a> I had built.
I was recently trying to squeeze every last LUT out of my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC design</a>, and
made changes to it.  I then changed it in another design, and again, and
eventually I had four different flash controllers and couldn’t tell which
worked and which didn’t.  I needed a test bench to prove that my changes
still left me with a working controller.</p>

    <p>I had no choice, but to backtrack and build the test bench I should’ve built
in the first place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only after things work on the test bench, will the expert place them onto
the FPGA.  Changes made in this process (usually because something just
doesn’t quite meet timing) will still be validated through the
simulator and the test bench.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the expert applies his design for its first Hardware in the Loop (HITL)
test.  If the hardware he’s working with doesn’t match his simulation,
he goes back and adjusts the simulation, his design, and the test bench.</p>

    <p>If I can, I like to use the same software for bench testing as I do for
hardware in the loop testing.  While this is not always possible, it can be
used to save a step … if you can.  That’s actually the reason why I like
to use a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/sw/host/netuart.cpp">TCP/IP
connection</a> to connect to my boards–because you can never
tell, then, whether you are connecting to the real thing or a simulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only after any design passes unit testing, is it fully integrated with the
rest of whatever the expert wishes to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the entire unit is tested as a whole.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The expert will also firmly scold the student for not following this form
exactly.  Sorry, students, it always happens.</p>

<h2 id="the-actual-design-process">The Actual Design Process</h2>

<p>The problem with this description of the expert’s design process is that the
expert isn’t telling the whole story.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Figure 3: Reality</caption><tr><td><img width="400" src="/img/actual-design-process.svg" alt="What the Expert actually does" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Because this isn’t his first design, he has already built up a small library
of routines–most of them surrounding how to communicate with an FPGA and how
to get diagnostics from the FPGA.  Indeed, his design flow is perhaps more
appropriately characterized by Fig 3.</p>

<p>The result is that the expert can draw values and hence insights from the logic
running within the FPGA, while the student is still stuck wondering what
happened.</p>

<p>In my case, this scaffolding consists of both my
open source <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">Wishbone Scope</a> that works 
with <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTK Wave</a>, and 2) my open source
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/wbubus/wbubus.v">UART to wishbone</a>
converter which gives you access to that
<a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone Bus</a>, to include the 
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a> that I place on that bus.
Of course, when I first started I didn’t have
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTK Wave</a> support–but that just illustrates
how an expert’s toolset can grow to become more useful over time.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-student-should-have-done">What the Student should have done</h2>

<p>What the student should have done was to take some time, between the simple
<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/blinky.html">blinky</a> and
<a href="/blog/2017/05/24/serial-port.html">UART</a>
projects but before the more complex projects, to build some scaffolding.
Specifically, he needs to build a means of evaluating logic from within the
FPGA, and of learning how to discover whether or not the device he’s working
with responds the way he thinks it should or not.</p>

<p>The typical curricula doesn’t lead the student to this approach.
Instead, the typical curricula works from
<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/blinky.html">blinky</a> to more and more
complex projects, but never focuses on how to build scaffolding out of these
projects that is necessary to be truly competent at the more complex tasks.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that 1) few students know that this is a
requirement on their road to success, and 2) few students allocate time for
failure along the way.</p>

<p>This is why student’s stumble on their complex FPGA design projects.</p>

<p>If this has been your experience, please write to me.  I’d love to share any
lessons you’ve learned from your design projects here on this blog.</p>
