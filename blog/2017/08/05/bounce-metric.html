    <p>Buttons and switches on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>s
can be very useful to work with.  This extra
user I/O on a development board can make life easier when trying to direct
what is going on within it, or when trying to debug logic within the board.
The problem is that these forms of inputs often
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bounce</a>”,
and produce multiple transitions when only one was directed.</p>

<p>This problem is particularly problematic in the fact that it is difficult
to simulate hardware
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bounces</a>,
since they tend to be quite random.</p>

<p>Our <a href="/blog/2017/08/02/debounce-teaser.html">first post</a>
on this topic looked into how this sort of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bouncing</a>
manifested.  It wasn’t pretty, as many buttons from several different
boards and even a keypad all demonstrated this problem.</p>

<p>Our <a href="/blog/2017/08/04/debouncing.html">second post</a>
discussed how to create the <a href="/blog/2017/08/04/debouncing.html">digital logic necessary to
debounce</a>
a user input.</p>

<p>Today, we’ll discuss how to measure the effect
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bouncing</a>
has on your input logic.</p>

<h1 id="measuring-the-reality-of-buttons-bouncing">Measuring the Reality of Buttons: Bouncing</h1>

<p>To try to capture this phenomena, let’s look at two things in particular.</p>

<p>First, we’ll count the number of state transitions as in Fig 1 below.  In
the case of a button,
the first transition should be when the button is pressed, and the second
transition when the button is released.  In the case of a switch, only
one transition should ever take place.  It either of the two
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bounces</a>, we should be
able to tell.  In particular, the number of transitions would be
something other than two for a button or one for a switch.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1: Measuring Transitions</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/button-transitions.svg" alt="Counting how many transitions a button creates" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The second thing we we might wish to measure is how many clocks it takes
for the transitions to take place.  For example, with a button, this will
be the number of clocks from the first press to the last bounce on release,
as shown in Fig 2 below.  It won’t tell us as much about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bouncing</a>, though, since
the bounces will have settled long before this measurement is concluded.
It might still tell us something about the nature and character of a button
press in general.  We can then use this information to understand how to
tune our <a href="/blog/2017/08/04/debouncing.html">debouncing
logic</a>.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2: Measuring Button Press Duration</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/button-duration.svg" alt="Counting a button press duration" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<h1 id="building-the-code-the-unbouncer">Building the code: The Unbouncer</h1>

<p>We’ll handle the first two measurements in a routine I’m going to call
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blog/master/rtl/unbounced.v">unbounced</a>.
This <em>unbouncer</em> will help to tell us what has been going on within our
design.</p>

<p>As we discussed during our discussion on
<a href="/blog/2017/08/04/debouncing.html">debouncing logic</a>,
the first step of necessity is going to be to synchronize our inputs.
This synchronization is our approach to take the incoming button logic
signal, and make sure that any logic depending upon this information has
its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#Timing_considerations">setup and
hold</a>
requirements met.  It also helps us avoid any issues with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_electronics">metastability</a>,
lest our logic act in an unpredictable (and incomprehensible) manner later.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">begin</span>
	<span class="c1">// Two clocks to synchronize asynchronous data</span>
	<span class="n">q_in</span>   <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">i_in</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="n">r_in</span>   <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">q_in</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// SYNCHRONIZED!</span>
	<span class="c1">// Keep track of last value, so we can find changes</span>
	<span class="n">r_last</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">r_in</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Once the inputs have been synchronized, we can then count the number of
times they change.  We’ll reset our count upon any reset request, but ever
afterwards we can just increment our counter on any changes:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_transitions</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r_last</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">r_in</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_transitions</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">o_transitions</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As we mentioned above, a button press should produce two transitions: one
when the button is pressed, and one when it is released.  Anything else is
an indication of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bouncing</a>.
This simple counter can be used to test whether there was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bounce</a> or not.</p>

<p>The other thing we’re going to want to do is count how much time it takes
from the initial change (button press) until the final change (button release).
We’ll use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">triggered</code> signal to determine when to run our counter, and
so run the counter any time after the button was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">triggered</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">triggered</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r_last</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">r_in</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">triggered</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s just remember that we’re going to need to reset our logic
between events, so we can re-trigger on the next event.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll keep track of the time since the last trigger:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">triggered</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">clock</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="p">]))</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that this “counter” measure will saturate once the top bit sets.  This
will give us about 21~seconds of measurement before losing track of what’s
going on (assuming a 100MHz clock).  That should be plenty for our purposes.</p>

<p>Once we have this “time-since-event” above, we can then measure the maximum
amount of time that takes place between the initial button press and the
last change.  We’ll set this to zero upon an external reset, and ever
afterwards if our button input <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r_in</code> doesn’t match what it was once clock
ago, we’ll update our maximum clock duration value.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_max_clock</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r_last</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">r_in</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_max_clock</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_max_clock</code> value will therefore capture the number of clocks between
a trigger and the last transition.</p>

<h2 id="coming-back-to-the-debug-bus">Coming back to the Debug Bus</h2>

<p>At this point, many students would turn to a
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-ssd-seven-segment-display/">7-segment display</a>,
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-8ld-eight-high-brightness-leds">LEDs</a>,
an <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmodclp-character-lcd-with-parallel-interface">LCD</a>,
or another <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-oledrgb-96-x-64-rgb-oled-display-with-16-bit-color-resolution/">display output</a>
to return these numbers.  This becomes a trap for
the student, though, because the problems associated with displaying these
values (particularly the <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-ssd-seven-segment-display/">7-segment
display</a>
or <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmodclp-character-lcd-with-parallel-interface">LCD</a>) can be just as complicated,
if not more so, than the simple button pressing logic we’ve presented above.
When this student then wants to isolate the bug he is getting to be either
the debouncing module or the display module, he can’t tell which is causing
the problem.</p>

<p>Let’s avoid this mistake by integrating our
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/debouncer.v">debouncing</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/unbounced.v">unbouncing</a>
logic into a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">debugging bus</a>, such as
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">one we built together
earlier</a>.</p>

<p>This will be our next step: How to integrate our
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/debouncer.v">debouncer</a>
together with
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/unbounced.v">today’s unbounced logic</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">debugging bus</a>, so that we can get
bounce information from within an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>.
Even better, if we include a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/wbscopc.v">compressed</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a> into that project, you’ll
be able to generate your own button bouncing traces.</p>
