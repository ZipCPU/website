    <p>The fundamental way to avoid <a href="/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a> is
to start from a small design and to build to a more complex design one small
piece at a time.  You might even call this <em>good engineering process.</em>  Along
the way, you’ll want to avoid changing too many things at once.  Lest, if you
introduce too many changes at the same time, you’ll never know which change
is keeping your design from working.  Hence, your goal should be to build
your complex designs from an initial simple design, modified by only simple
changes.</p>

<p>The corollary to this rule is to make certain that your test and debug
infrastructure, I like to call this your <em>scaffolding</em>, is never one of
multiple unknowns within your design.  There is a time for testing the
scaffolding of your design: <em>before you need it</em>.  You want to be convinced
in the reliability of your scaffolding before you ever commit your time
and design to its strength.</p>

<p>This has a particular application when you wish to use the buttons, switches,
or keypad entry mechanisms to your design.  My advice?  Don’t use them as part
of your debug infrastructure until you have <em>proven</em> that they work the way
you want them to work first.  The reason is that buttons bounce, and
creating a signal that doesn’t bounce requires digital logic.</p>

<p>What makes a button debouncing circuit particularly unique when it comes to
debugging, is that it is
difficult to test apart from using a real button.  You just can’t simulate
an unknown piece of hardware’s response very well.  This is what makes the
coupling of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">debugging bus</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a> so powerful: using them,
you can not only measure what’s going on any time a button gets pressed, but
you can also measure whether or not your debouncing logic works within that
context.</p>

<p>In this article, we will examine how to debounce a set of button inputs,
so that they can then be used as part of your test infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="generating-events">Generating Events</h2>

<p>User inputs, whether they be button presses, switches, or other, can be a very
valuable part of your design.  They can be used
to reset your board, to start a test, or even to enter data into your design.
Indeed, once you cut the umbilical (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG">JTAG</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a>, or
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/">debugging bus</a>) to your
board, such inputs may be the only means you have remaining of controlling
your board.</p>

<p>To understand how valuable these inputs can be, consider the following
scenarios where student’s have tried to use a button:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>One student thought it would be nice to create a design that prints <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot;Hello,_World!&quot;_program">Hello
World</a>
anytime a button is pressed.</p>

    <p>This student hadn’t yet gotten his first serial port to work.  By adding
the button processing to his design, he added an additional unknown to the
design and was thus unable to discern which piece of logic was failing
when the whole didn’t work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another student’s challenge was to increment a counter every time a key was
pressed.
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/3992-something-simple-is-apparently-impossible-incrdec-number/">[1]</a></p>

    <p>This sounds easy, right?</p>

    <p>This student was surprised to discover that every time he pressed a button,
his counter jumped by more than a single count.  He was expecting a single
state change only.  Indeed, his design depended upon being able to detect
singular button press events.  The multiple detected events “broke” the
design he was building.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While both of these applications are valid applications of a button, both
students ended up stuck with an FPGA design that didn’t work because they
weren’t aware of the difficulty associated with buttons: they bounce.</p>

<p>Turning a button from a bouncing electrical signal into a useful entry method
requires some <em>debouncing logic</em>.</p>

<h2 id="metastability-and-avoiding-the-beginners-mistakes">Metastability, and avoiding the beginner’s mistakes</h2>

<p>Before we dig deeply into how to <em>debounce</em> a button, let’s take a quick
moment to mention how <em>not</em> to work with a button.</p>

<p>The beginner is often enticed by the capabilities of a chip to transition on 
a positive edge.  Hence, I’ve seen many beginners start their approach with</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="kt">event</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_button</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="c1">// Reset our system whenever i_reset is true</span>
		<span class="kt">event</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span>
	<span class="k">else</span>
		<span class="kt">event</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The same mistake can be manifest in an attempt to count events, as in:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="kt">event</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_button</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Both of these approaches to measuring buttons are problematic.</p>

<p>Here’s why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Timing</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_button</code> is not a clock.  Your tool-suite will struggle to
analyze the timing between when a button press event takes place and
the rest of the logic within your design.  It’s going to try to optimize
the distance (in time and space) between the button press logic taking
place and the logic that depends upon it, and since the button press wasn’t
a clock the result will be difficult to analyze.  The result will be
unreliable logic in the rest of your circuit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asynchronous reset</strong>’s tend to have a propagation delay when they work
their way through your circuitry.  Therefore, they may reset one portion
of your circuitry before another.  While this might not be such a problem
if every part of the circuit gets reset eventually, this doesn’t mitigate
the exit from the asynchronous reset .  Hence, when using an asynchronous
reset, you may find some pieces of logic are released from reset before
other pieces of logic. (This is <em>bad</em>)</p>

    <p>Particularly problematic are spurious reset signals that last for less than
a clock interval, perhaps created by some radio frequency interference
within the FPGA board’s environment.  These signals may partially but not
completely reset an FPGA’s logic.</p>

    <p><strong>The beginner’s reset rule:</strong> Just avoid the asynchronous reset.  This
is easily done by removing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">posedge i_reset</code> from the dependency line in
the always block.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given this information, let’s try to build our logic again:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">down</span>  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="kt">event</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">begin</span>
		<span class="n">down</span>  <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
		<span class="kt">event</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">begin</span>
		<span class="n">down</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">i_button</span><span class="p">;</span>
		<span class="kt">event</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_button</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">down</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This approach, while better than the first one, is still problematic.</p>

<p>While this avoids the asynchronous reset, it now has a problem with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_electronics">metastability</a>. 
Specifically, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_button</code> may not have settled for enough time prior to the
clock to create a stable logic signal.  As a result, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">down</code> register may
be indeterminate. Some parts of your circuitry may decide <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">down</code> is true,
while other parts deciding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">down</code> is false.  You may get two events in a
row, or no events at all.</p>

<p>To avoid these problems, stick to these rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the positive edge of a single clock for <em>all</em> of your logic.
I like to use the same basic clock wire, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_clk</code>, within all my modules
for this purpose.  The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_clk</code> signal itself is either externally generated,
or the result of a PLL applied to an external clock signal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For any logic inputs that are not created synchronously to your clock,
such as your button inputs, clock them through a pair of flip flops
(example below).  This applies to all external user input devices, such
as buttons, switches, and keypad entry.  This rule also applies to all
of your external asynchronous inputs as well: PS/2 devices, UARTs, or
indeed any wires coming from external circuits that do not share your clock.</p>

    <p>While this alone doesn’t solve the problem of bouncing, it will make
actually dealing with it a lot easier.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Using these rules, we can create a clock synchronous button input.  The first
step is to run the button input through two flip-flops to avoid any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_electronics">metastability</a>
issues.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">sync_pipe</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">r_button_state</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">r_button_state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sync_pipe</span> <span class="o">}</span>
		<span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">sync_pipe</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i_button</span> <span class="o">}</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r_button_state</code> has now gone through two flip flops from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_button</code>, and so
it will be a one or a zero to all logic within your FPGA.  Now that the
button input has been synchronized to our clock, we can detect when the
button input changes with such simple code as:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">r_last</span>         <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">r_button_event</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">begin</span>
	<span class="n">r_last</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">r_button_state</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="n">r_button_event</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r_button_state</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">r_last</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The nice part of this technique for generating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r_button_event</code>, is that it
will only ever be true <em>once</em> for every time the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_button</code> goes from off to
on.</p>

<p>The other common piece of logic drawn from an external button input is a
counter.  Let’s assume that our reset input, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_reset</code> is synchronous–perhaps
you created it via the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">dbgbus</a>
infrastructure <a href="/blog/2017/06/28/dbgbus-goal.html">we’ve already
built</a>.  We can
use that input to increment our counter, and then we can use the button event
we just created to increment a counter:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_reset</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r_button_event</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>At this point we’ve only solved the problems with metastability, the
asynchronous clock, and synchronizing the button input to our clock.
Now that we know how to avoid these mistakes, let’s <em>debounce</em> this button.</p>

<h2 id="a-very-simple-debouncer">A Very Simple Debouncer</h2>

<p>The basic approach to debouncing a button is to prevent the button’s output
from changing more than once every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> clocks.  Hence, we’ll build our
approach to debouncing around a timer, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timer</code>, that simply counts down to
zero.  Any time this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timer</code> reaches zero, the current value will be forwarded
to the output.  Further, we can control the time interval by just adjusting
the number of bits in the timer.  We’ll call this number of bits <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LGWAIT</code>.</p>

<p>Given those goals, here’s the code for a very simple digital logic debouncer:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span> <span class="n">timer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">LGWAIT</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="o">}}</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">timer</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">timer</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">timer</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_debounced</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">r_button_state</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This approach should be good enough for most uses, so if you just want a very
simple debouncing circuit this one will work.</p>

<p>However, if the latency in reporting the button press is important to you,
this piece of logic may cause the button press indication to wait for up to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2^(LGWAIT)</code> samples before being reported.  This problem is shown in Fig
1 below.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1: Traditional Debouncer</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/debounce-traditional.svg" alt="Traditional debouncing logic" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This figure shows a “slow timer” in its top line.  Any time the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timer</code>
finishes counting down, the slow timer line changes as a visual reference.
Notice then how the button press needs to wait on a transition in 
slow timer (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timer == 0</code>) before it reports a button press?
That latency is what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>So, let’s return to this concept and see if we can’t do any better.</p>

<h2 id="a-debouncer-with-more-immediate-results">A Debouncer with more Immediate Results</h2>

<p>This time, let’s rebuild this debouncing circuit around the idea that a
pressed button should be reported immediately, but that following changes
should be held off at least <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N=2^(LGWAIT)</code> clocks after that.  Fig 2 captures
this concept.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2: Low-latency debouncer</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/debounce-immediate.svg" alt="An immediate response debouncer" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In this approach, the timer starts when the first change is detected.
While the timer is counting, changes are not permitted.  As a result, the
latency should be much lower than before.</p>

<p>We’ll follow some of the lessons from our post on how to <a href="/blog/2017/06/12/minimizing-luts.html">minimize
logic resources</a>.
In particular, we’ll use a second register, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztimer</code>, together with our timer.
This register will be a single wire only, and we’ll set it to true any time
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timer</code> is zero.  Finally, as we are going to set this up, any time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztimer</code>
is true the circuit will be responsive to a changing signal.</p>

<p>So here’s the code for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timer</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztimer</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">ztimer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span>

		<span class="n">timer</span>  <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The count-down will begin any time the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timer</code> is at zero (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztimer</code> is high),
and the inputs are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">different</code> from what they were.  (We’ll come back to this
in a moment.)    Once the timer is running, it will count down to zero.
When it hits zero, it will hold there until another change has been detected.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, we’ll use the register <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">different</code> to signal any time the
input is different from the output of our debouncing circuit.  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">different</code>,
though, will then need to remain true until any ongoing countdown completes.
Hence, as long as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">different</code> gets set, either when the timer isn’t counting
or between count-downs, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">different</code> will make sure that the timer restarts
again.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">different</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">different</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">ztimer</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">||</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">r_in</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">o_debounced</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We now finally have all the pieces necessary to create our low-latency
debounced output.  This output will be set to whatever we just finished
reading, but only ever anytime <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztimer</code> is set.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">o_debounced</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NIN</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">}</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ztimer</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_debounced</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">r_last</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice the choice to set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_debounced</code> any time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztimer</code> is true, coupled with
the fact that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztimer</code> idles at zero.  Because of this, any time a button is
pressed (or released), while the circuit is idle (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztimer</code> is true), will
immediately adjust <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_debounced</code> with the new value.  Subsequent bounces,
until the signal becomes stable again, will be limited to only change every
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2^LGWAIT</code> clocks.</p>

<p>Now, if we go back and review some of the button presses from the <a href="/blog/2017/08/02/debounce-teaser.html">opening
post on debouncing</a>,
you’ll be able to understand the debounced trace in Fig 3. below.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3: Debouncing Result</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/kypad.png" alt="Example debouncing trace" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In particular, notice how the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debounced</code> trace changes immediately as soon
as the button is pressed, and before it is done bouncing.  It doesn’t change
again until all the bouncing is over, and the user releases the button.</p>

<p>This demonstrates that our logic actually worked.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>While this post presents <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/debouncer.v">working debouncing
logic</a>, the
task remains far from complete.  For example, how many bits (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LGWAIT</code>) need
to be allocated to the counter?  Not quite so subtle is the question of how
shall this capability be proven?  In particular, this logic requires
an external button input bounce in order to properly verify its functionality.</p>

<p>Our <a href="/blog/2017/08/05/bounce-metric.html">next post</a>,
therefore, will focus on
<a href="/blog/2017/08/05/bounce-metric.html">how to measure bounces</a>
so we can
tell if a bounce has taken place.  After that, we’ll discuss
<a href="/blog/2017/08/07/bounce-dbgbus.html">how to modify the</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">debugging bus</a> for this purpose, and to get
a trace from within the design so we can see what’s going on.  Then we’ll go
and move on to the next topic.</p>
