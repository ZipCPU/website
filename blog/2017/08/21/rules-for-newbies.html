    <p>It’s a new school year!</p>

<p>For all you new students out there, please accept
my welcome to the wonderful world of digital design.  I am neither a student
nor a professor, and yet I have helped many students through their projects
on the <a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">Digilent forum</a>, as well as on
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net">freenode IRC</a>.</p>

<p>This post is an outgrowth of my own experience counseling beginners on
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">Digilent’s forums</a>.  Indeed, sometimes I
feel like I’m a broken record there repeating over and over the same rules
for newbies.</p>

<p>So, before you ask for help, here are a couple rules to keep you from
running into the same trouble others have gotten stuck within:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Build your design with only one clock.</p>

    <p>If the clock that comes into your chip is the wrong speed for your one
clock, then use a <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug472_7Series_Clocking.pdf">PLL/MMCM</a> to create the speed you want/need.</p>

    <p><a href="/blog/2017/06/02/generating-timing.html">This post</a>
discusses a variety of alternative timing approaches, done within clocked
logic, that don’t require additional clocks to work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do <em>not</em> transition on any negative (falling) edges.</p>

    <p>Falling edge clocks should be considered a violation of the one
clock principle, as they act like separate clocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do <em>not</em> transition on the positive (rising) edge of anything other than
your system clock.</p>

    <p>Lot’s of students seem to want to <a href="/blog/2017/08/04/debouncing.html">treat a button like a
clock</a>, for example.
They then struggle to understand why their design isn’t working.
<a href="/blog/2017/08/04/debouncing.html">Here</a> are some
better approaches that actually work with buttons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Synchronize all external wire inputs by passing them through two clocked
flip-flops before using them.</p>

    <p>This helps to avoid problems with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_electronics">metastability</a>.
We discussed <a href="/blog/2017/08/04/debouncing.html">how to synchronize inputs
here</a> when dealing with
buttons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do <em>not</em> use an asynchronous reset within your design.</p>

    <p>Test for any reset within an always block on the positive edge of your system
clock like everything else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simulate everything before placing it onto your hardware</p>

    <p>The unique thing about simulation is that a good simulator will allow you
to see and examine <em>every</em> piece of logic on <em>every</em> simulated clock.
A good simulator will also allow you to simulate any external peripherals,
so that you don’t need your hardware to run your simulator.</p>

    <p>You can read about <a href="/blog//2017/06/23/my-dbg-philosophy.html">my own debugging philosophy
here</a>.</p>

    <p>You can also read about <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">how to simulate hardware together with your design
here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build unit tests that can “prove” your components work, via a simulator,
so that when you later make changes to “improve” the component, you will
know that the improvements haven’t broken anything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build simulations that will support not only unit test, but also full up
integration testing</p>

    <p>This was also discussed in the post about <a href="/blog/2017/06/23/my-dbg-philosophy.html">my own debugging
philosophy</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you simulate whatever means you will use for debugging your design
before you transition to hardware.</p>

    <p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> can
be a very difficult black box to get debugging information out of.  Before
you transition your design into an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>, I
recommend having some means of getting debugging information back out.  This
means needs to be simulated and proven along with everything else.</p>

    <p>If you’ve read much of my blog, you’ll know that I highly recommend
<a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">using a debugging
bus</a> that
controls your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> over
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">IP</a>.  That allows you <a href="/blog/2017/06/17/why-network-debugging.html">to
control</a>
your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
simulation, or your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> itself,
from the same software.</p>

    <p>While there are proprietary solutions to this problem that do not require a
<a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">debugging bus</a>,
you may struggle to integrate your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
interaction software with them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic numbers</a></p>

    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic number</a>
is a number that shows up without explanation or dependency within your code.</p>

    <p>This one is so important, that <a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus
Muller</a> chose to echo this sentiment
as well in the twitter section down below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never write the same code twice.</p>

    <p>Write it once, write it well, and then reuse it.  Fix it, if you must fix
it, just don’t rewrite it over and over again for every project.   If done
well, this will give you a jump start on any future projects.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rules-for-software-engineers">Rules for software engineers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hardware design is <em>not</em> like software design</p>

    <p>In software, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code> or a debugger to <em>see</em> every variable in
your algorithm.  In an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>, you
will struggle to <em>see</em> anything.</p>

    <p>Even if you could <em>see</em> everything in an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>, you
wouldn’t be able to stop the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> to
<em>see</em> any high speed interactions like you can stop a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger">debugger</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simulation first.</p>

    <p>The only time you will be able to <em>see</em> everything is in simulation.  Start
your debugging process there.
<a href="/blog//2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">This post</a>
discusses how you can continue debugging by <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf()</code>–but
only in simulation, should you wish to do so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get familiar with a logic analyzer on your first project</p>

    <p>While you can’t <em>see</em> everything in an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>, and
especially not when you are running at speed, you can get a trace from a
running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
showing how logic transitions over time.</p>

    <p>Such a trace can come from an external logic analyzer.  Many of these are
available for purchase.  For example, I’ve used the <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/digital-discovery-portable-logic-analyzer-and-digital-pattern-generator/">Digital
Discovery</a>
to find bugs in <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">one of my projects</a>.  I’m
hoping to blog about my experiences with it soon as well.  I also have the
<a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Open_Bench_Logic_Sniffer">Open Bench Logic
Sniffer</a>
on my desk waiting to be tried and tested.</p>

    <p>We’ve also discussed using an internal scope many times on this blog.
Such scope’s are <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">not hard to
build</a>, and can be
<em>very</em> useful when trying to figure out what’s going on.  I personally use a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a>.  We’ve discussed how to
set that up
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teach your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
to do some of your debugging for you.</p>

    <p>Learn to <a href="/blog/2017/05/24/serial-port.html">set an LED when error conditions take
place</a>.</p>

    <p>Learn to trigger your “trace” generation on error conditions, so you can
read back logic leading up to those “error conditions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="just-for-students">Just for students</h2>

<p>I’ve seen a lot of <a href="/blog/2017/06/10/lost-college-student.html">students get
burned</a>.  While
some might say that this is a normal part of the learning process, don’t let
it be your process.  Learn from those who have gone before you.  Specific
lessons I would share include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Success is measured by the number of failures.  Plan for failure.</p>

    <p><em>Every</em> student tends to come across some “impossible”
problem in his design that he cannot figure out.  He may get stuck at this
point for days or even weeks.  This is common.  <em>Plan</em> on getting stuck,
put some time into your schedule in case this happens,
and then plan before hand on how you are going to get yourself unstuck.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t start your project at the last minute.</p>

    <p>Good engineering takes time to do, and to do right.  You cannot control
when things will go wrong, or how long it will take to fix things when it
does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plan on debugging from the beginning.  Build yourself the infrastructure
you need for that task first, then build your design.</p>

    <p>o All of my designs include both one or more  <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone
  scopes</a></p>

    <p>o All of my designs include a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/wbubus.v">wishbone to
  UART</a>
  <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus</a>
  giving me access to my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scopes</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">this
discussion</a>
on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
design process, and learn what both instructors and experts often overlook
when they teach you how to do the task.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rules-from-twitter">Rules from Twitter</h2>

<p>Many thanks to those who know <a href="https://twitter.com/zipcpu">me on twitter</a>!
They also offered the following pieces of advice for new students: (some edits
applied)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My boss would tell me “Think in hardware” #parallel execution of code,
not serial. <a href="https://twitter.com/sachin_bhutada">sachin_bhutada</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you, <a href="https://twitter.com/sachin_bhutada">sachin_bhutada</a>,
this may be one of the most common struggles software students have.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the right device for your job.  Need to do 100kOps/s of multiplications?
Pah, you cheapest MCU can do that.  Remember: designing in HDL is hard,
programming in C is easy.  <a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus Muller</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think <a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus Muller</a> meant to say that
programming in C++ is easy …</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One week of aimless development can easily save you two hours of writing
specifications.  <a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus Muller</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use build-time parameters instead of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic constants</a>;
you’ll thank me later.  <a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus Muller</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When working in a team, beat others with a stuck until they learn to
properly use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus Muller</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t believe hypes.  <a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus Muller</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it’s complicated, make a drawing.  <a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus Muller</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get a good book.  The online tutorials you find are … spotty, at best.  Learn the basics first.  <a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus Muller</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I often recommend <a href="http://www.asic-world.com/verilog/veritut.html">asic-world’s online
tutorials</a>, but
<a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus Muller</a>’s advice still rings
true.  “Learn the basics first.”  <a href="">This blog</a>
cannot cover all of the basics.</p>

<p>Indeed, his comments hit the nail on the head so well, I’ve struggled here to
figure out anything to add to them.</p>

<p>As for <a href="">this blog</a> and what you will find here, I’m just
going to go back and underline <a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus
Muller</a>’s advice to “Learn the basics
first.”
Thank you, <a href="https://twitter.com/dEnergy_dTime">Marcus Muller</a>!</p>

<p>Indeed, thank you again to all who responded!</p>

<h2 id="rules-are-made-to-be-broken">Rules are made to be broken</h2>

<p>Please notice how I titled this post as “Rules for new FPGA designers”.  These rules are
for <em>beginners</em>.  Those who have worked with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>s for a
longer period of time will understand that there are times and places for all
of these rules to be broken.</p>

<p>To those who are contemplating breaking these rules, who may be at the point of
moving from a beginning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> designer to a more intermediate one, my advice is
this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carefully consider your steps.  Do you really need to break the rule?  My
twitter friends and I
shared these rules for a reason.  Don’t break them unless you absolutely
need to.  Further, if you do absolutely need to break the rule, do your
research first so that you know how to do so safely and reliably.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="this-isnt-the-last-word">This isn’t the last word</h2>

<p>I expect I’ll come back to this post many times to update my rules for
beginners.  So, if you’ve read this once, don’t be surprised if it changes
again later as I add to these rules.</p>

<p>Have I missed anything?  Feel free to let me know at the address below,
and thank you for everyone who has contributed so far.</p>

<p>Finally good luck, have some fun, and stay out of
