    <p>As we’ve discussed in our two previous posts,
buttons and switches on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>s
can be very useful to work with.  They can be
very useful tools when debugging as well.  The problem is that these forms of
inputs often “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bounce</a>”,
and produce multiple edges when only one is desired.  This can be a problem
when you wish to depend or rely upon these inputs as being a dependable
part of a debugging solution–before you’ve managed to ensure their
dependability.</p>

<p>Making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">contact bounce</a>
particularly problematic is the fact that it is difficult to simulate, since
the bounces tend to appear quite random.</p>

<p>Our <a href="/blog/2017/08/02/debounce-teaser.html">first post</a>
on this topic looked into how this sort of bouncing manifested, showing
several examples and traces of contact bounces.  The pictures weren’t very
pretty, as many buttons from several different boards and even a keypad all
manifested this problem.</p>

<p>Our <a href="/blog/2017/08/04/debouncing.html">second post</a>
discussed how to create the digital logic necessary to debounce a user
input.</p>

<p>We then <a href="/blog/2017/08/05/bounce-metric.html">created some simple test
points</a> that could
be used to measure button press duration and the number of times a particular
button press bounced.</p>

<p>Today, our discussion is going to focus on how to connect these two
components to the <a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">wishbone
bus</a> present within our
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbus.v">debugging-bus testing
logic</a>.
We’re also going to add a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">compressed wishbone scope</a>
to the design in order to get the traces out of our design such as were
presented in the <a href="/blog/2017/08/02/debounce-teaser.html">initial
post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="instantiating-the-two-components">Instantiating the two components</h2>

<p>Over the course of the last two posts, we’ve created two components that
we would now like to test: 
a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/debouncer.v">debouncer</a>,
and an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/unbounced.v">unbounced</a>
module.  We are going to test these two components by pressing a button, and
then reading the results produced by these two components as registers on a
bus.  Once read, we’ll use the bus to reset these components.</p>

<p>We’ll start by assuming we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NBTNS</code> buttons, in a vector named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_button</code>
coming into our top level design.  This vector, together with our system
clock, can then be used as inputs to these two modules, as in:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="n">debouncer</span>	<span class="p">#(</span><span class="n">NBTNS</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">thedebouncer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i_button</span><span class="p">,</span>
				<span class="n">debounced</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">debounce_dbg</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">unbounced</span>	<span class="p">#(</span><span class="n">NBTNS</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">theunbouncer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">unbounce_reset</span><span class="p">,</span>
				<span class="n">i_button</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">transitions</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">max_clock</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The result of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/debouncer.v">debouncer</a>
is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NBTNS</code>-bit vector <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debounced</code>.  This vector is a copy of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_button</code>,
save only that it has been both synchronized to the clock and any bounces
have been removed.</p>

<p>The two results of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/unbounced.v">unbounced</a>
vector are two 31-bit vectors: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transitions</code> which holds the number of
transitions, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max_clock</code> which holds the number of clock ticks from the
first transition to the last.</p>

<p>The other two items are the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unbounce_reset</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debounce_dbg</code>.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unbounce_reset</code> line clears the counters.  We’ll hook that up in the
next section.  The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debounce_dbg</code> lines, however, we’ll come back to when
we discuss hooking the debouncer up to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone
scope</a>.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-the-components-to-the-debugging-bus">Connecting the components to the debugging bus</h2>

<p>We’d like to hook these two peripherals to our wishbone debugging bus,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbus.v">testbus.v</a>.
In particular, we’d like to be able to read these three values from an
external UART.  Since reading the values requires no logic handshake with
the modules, they can be hooked up just as simply as any of the other
simple registers within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbus.v">testbus.v</a>.</p>

<p>To hook this new peripheral up, just assign it an address among our
simple data peripheral’s address map:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">case</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">wb_addr</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
	<span class="p">...</span>
	<span class="mh">4'h6</span><span class="o">:</span>    <span class="n">smpl_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">transitions</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="mh">4'h7</span><span class="o">:</span>    <span class="n">smpl_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">max_clock</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="mh">4'h8</span><span class="o">:</span>    <span class="n">smpl_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">NBTNS</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">}}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">debounced</span> <span class="o">}</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="p">...</span>
	<span class="nl">defult:</span> <span class="n">smpl_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">32'h0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">endcase</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Don’t forget when using these addresses, that each address references a
32-bit quantity, and hence they need to be multiplied by four to get the
offset into the address map.
Hence, address offsets of 24, 28, and 32 from the simple data peripheral
now contain our new values.  Given that we placed our simple data peripheral
at an address offset of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x2040</code>, that means these new registers will have
final addresses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x2058</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x205c</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x2060</code>.</p>

<p>One other change is required to the bus, we need to create our reset signal,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unbounce_reset</code>.  We’re going to set this reset signal up so that any time
we write to either of these registers, either the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transitions</code> or the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max_clock</code> register, we reset our counters:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">unbounce_reset</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">wb_stb</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">wb_we</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">smpl_sel</span><span class="p">)</span>
				<span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">wb_addr</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mb">3'b011</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it!  That’s all the changes that are necessary in order to connect
these two new peripherals to our bus.  Gosh, if it’s that easy, why not
try your own peripherals?</p>

<p>Before moving to the next section, there’s one other difference.  If you
compare this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbus.v">new top level
design</a>
with the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbus.v">initial top level
design</a>,
you’ll notice that the block RAM has been removed.  This was to provide
extra block RAM space for the wishbone scope—space that was never
really needed in the end.</p>

<h2 id="switching-to-a-compressed-wishbone-scope">Switching to a compressed wishbone scope</h2>

<p>There are three RTL steps to setting up a wishbone scope within your design.</p>

<p>The first step is to create a trigger.  You can find the trigger I
created in the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/debouncer.v">debouncer</a>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">trigger</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">ztimer</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">different</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">i_in</span><span class="p">))</span>
			<span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">timer</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">LGWAIT</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">timer</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This trigger is designed to stop the scope any time the debouncing logic
is complete, <em>and</em> the button’s logic value(s) has returned to zero.  In
practice, it didn’t work very well for testing the keypad, since the keypad
uses negative logic (a button release sends the signal high, not low).
The end result was that I often needed to trigger the scope manually from the
debugging bus, but we’ll come back to this in a moment.</p>

<p>The next step in connecting the scope is to select the data lines you wish
to record.  Here, let’s connect to our synchronized inputs, the debounced
result, as well as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztimer</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trigger</code> logic from within the design.
Because buttons take place over a very long period of time, we’ll need
to use the compressed wishbone scope.  That’s going to limit our debugging
width to 31-bits instead of 32.  (The last bit is used for run length
encoding.)</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="c1">//	debug[31] is used for RLE encoding, and thus not available to us here</span>

<span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">o_debug</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">debug</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>While this approach limits the number of inputs to 13-bits in a 14-bit
field, the logic within the actual <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/debouncer.v">debouncer
code</a>
makes it possible to record up to 14-bits, and to process any number of
buttons up to an arbitrary width.</p>

<p>The final change is to adjust the scope itself.  Switching from an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/wbscope.v">uncompressed wishbone scope</a> to a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/wbscopc.v">compressed wishbone scope</a>
is almost as easy as changing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wbscope</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wbscopc</code>.  Indeed, the two share
an almost identical interface standard.  The only more substantial change
beyond changing the name is adjusting the input data width from 32-bits down
to the 31-bits of the compressed scope.  We’ll also pull the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scope_trigger</code>
from its bit position within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debug</code> vector coming from the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/debouncer.v">debouncer
code</a>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">scope_trigger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">debounce_dbg</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">29</span><span class="p">];</span>

<p>Setting up the design for this purpose is really just that easy.</p>

<h2 id="adjusting-the-register-definition-files">Adjusting the register definition files</h2>

<p>Finally, I adjusted the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/regdefs.h">regdefs.h</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/regdefs.cpp">regdefs.cpp</a>
files to reflect that there are two new registers
in our design, giving them names that I can use to access them both from
my own C code
(<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/regdefs.h">regdefs.h</a>),
as well as from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wbregs</code> command line
(<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/regdefs.cpp">regdefs.cpp</a>).</p>

<p>The first change was to
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/regdefs.h">regdefs.h</a>,
where we needed to define our three new registers:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="cp">#define	R_TRANSITIONS	0x00002058
#define	R_MAXCLOCKS	0x0000205c
#define	R_DEBOUNCED	0x00002060</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You may remember from our discussion above that these are the addresses
of these three new registers within our simple data peripheral’s address space.</p>

<p>I then gave these registers user-friendly names by modifying
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/regdefs.cpp">regdefs.cpp</a>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">R_DEBOUNCED</span>	  <span class="p">,</span>	<span class="s">"DEBOUNCED"</span>	<span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">R_TRANSITIONS</span>	  <span class="p">,</span>	<span class="s">"BOUNCES"</span>	<span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">R_TRANSITIONS</span>	  <span class="p">,</span>	<span class="s">"TRANSITIONS"</span>	<span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">R_MAXCLOCKS</span>	  <span class="p">,</span>	<span class="s">"DURATION"</span>	<span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">R_MAXCLOCKS</span>	  <span class="p">,</span>	<span class="s">"MAXCLOCKS"</span>	<span class="p">},</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This only modifies a structure providing a mapping from register values
to user register names.</p>

<p>The final change was to create a piece of C++ code to read from the
wishbone scope.  You can see what this new scope code looks like
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/btnscope.cpp">here</a>,
although how to develop this code is discussed in general
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">here</a>.
Build and run this new
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/btnscope.cpp">btnscope</a>
program, and you’ll have a <a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">VCD
file</a> that you can then use with
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a> to view traces showing how your own
buttons bounce–just like the <a href="/blog/2017/08/02/debounce-teaser.html">traces I presented when we first
started</a>.</p>

<p>That’s it!  We can now grab two registers from our button press, and read
their results via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wbregs duration</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wbregs bounces</code>.  We can also reset
our count by writing to either of these registers via something like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wbregs duration 0</code>.  Using
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/btnscope.cpp">btnscope</a>,
we can also read and create <a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">VCD
files</a>.</p>

<h2 id="scripts-to-access-the-design">Scripts to access the design</h2>

<p>After using this design over and over several times, I got tired of typing
the same commands over and over.  As a result, I wrote two scripts to
make things easier.</p>

<p>The first script,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/getinfo.sh">getinfo.sh</a>,
simple reads the two registers and dumps them into a file record for later
analysis.  It also manually triggers the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a> in case it hadn’t
triggered yet.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

wbregs bounces  | <span class="nb">tee</span> <span class="nt">-a</span> btndata.txt
wbregs duration | <span class="nb">tee</span> <span class="nt">-a</span> btndata.txt
wbregs scope 0x88000020</code></pre></figure>

<p>The second script,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/sw/reset.sh">reset.sh</a>,
resets the logic for another button press.  Specifically, it resets the
scope (i.e. writes to it with the high data clear), and then attempts to
write to the bounce count.  As with any write to either of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/unbounced.v">unbounced</a>
registers, this will set the reset line to the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/unbounced.v">unbounced</a>
module for one clock, and thus reset the counters.  Finally, just to be
certain that the two registers actually cleared as desired, they are read
after reset.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

wbregs scope 0x020 <span class="c"># Reset the scope</span>
wbregs bounces 0   <span class="c"># Reset the unbounced code</span>
wbregs bounces     <span class="c"># Verify that the two counts have returned to zero</span>
wbregs duration</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That’s it!  You now have all the information you need to either build and
measure your own debouncer, or to just measure the bounces on your own
device.  Further, all of the debouncing logic, design, and software files
have been placed into their own
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer">GitHub repo</a> for your own reference.</p>
