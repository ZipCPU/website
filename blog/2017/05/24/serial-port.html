    <p>Getting your first communications port up and running on an FPGA can be a <em>real</em>
challenge.  After you get your serial port up and running, you can then use it
to get the next item up and running–since a serial port can provide a lot of 
feedback.  But until you can read that feedback, how can you avoid
<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA hell</a> long enough to
get that first port up and running?</p>

<h2 id="the-easy-way">The easy way</h2>

<p>If you want to do things the easy way, then just connect your serial port logic
to a known working
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a>
simulator, such as <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/bench/cpp/uartsim.cpp">this
one</a>,
and examine the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump">VCD</a>
output until you get the right answers from the serial
port.  As an example, consider the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/bench/verilog/helloworld.v">helloworld.v</a>
module, together with the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/bench/cpp/helloworld.cpp">helloworld.cpp</a>
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> driver,
for inspiration on how you might do this.</p>

<p>Once your hello world design runs in the simulator, and once you get “Hello
World” on the screen, you are reading for real hardware.</p>

<p>That’s the easy way.</p>

<h2 id="building-your-own-simulator">Building your own simulator</h2>

<p>But … what happens if you wish to communicate with your FPGA over something
other than a serial port, and you have no serial port to bootstrap your
efforts?</p>

<p>In that case, you’ll want to build your own simulator.</p>

<p>Since I’ve done this so often, I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/sim/verilator/testb.h">test bench C++
class</a>
which I often use for wrapping the
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
commands within a simulator. 
While it doesn’t handle all of the
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
code, it does handle most of it.  Still, there’s often quite a bit of work
to be done.  You can see examples of simulators I’ve built for
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c/blob/master/bench/cpp">I2C controller</a>,
a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpmic/blob/master/bench/cpp">PMod MIC controller</a>,
a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi/blob/master/bench/cpp">SPI based SD-card controller</a>,
or even the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/bench/cpp">wishbone scope</a>, which I hope to work our way up to in this blog.</p>

<p>I would also recommend making heavy use of the
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/">C assert</a>
statement any time your code <em>must</em> do something.  For example, if you must
wait at least 20 clocks from any request to the next, then count clocks within
your simulator and
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/">assert</a>
that the time between accesses is less than 20.  Just be careful to make
certain you flush any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump">VCD</a>
file you are creating before calling
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/">assert</a>, lest
you don’t get the data leading up to it.
(The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/sim/verilator/testb.h">test bench
class</a>
was recently updated to handle this by default)</p>

<p>Once your code works in your simulated environment, the next step is to try
it on the hardware.</p>

<h2 id="the-easy-move-to-hardware">The Easy Move to Hardware</h2>

<p>The easy way of getting this next step going is to use an oscilloscope.  You’ll
want to build a development board with particular “test-points” where you can
hook up the probe for the scope, and see what’s going on.  Barring test points
on the actual wires, sometimes you can use a general purpose I/O pin to become
a test point.</p>

<p>This is also the expensive way.</p>

<p>I don’t own a scope, neither do I have the cash to design my own boards, so …
enjoy this approach if you can do it.</p>

<h2 id="the-harder-way-to-get-hardware-working">The Harder way to get Hardware Working</h2>

<p>The difficult part of this first task on your hardware is, how do you know
what’s going on at high speed?  If you don’t have an Oscilloscope to measure
that high speed interaction, if all you have are your LED’s and your clock,
how shall you get to the next step?</p>

<p>The answer is to use your LED(s), just like we discussed when <a href="/blog/2017/05/19/blinky.html">building
blinky</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look a some particular tests you can try.</p>

<h2 id="look-for-whether-or-not-the-serial-port-is-getting-set">Look for whether or not the serial port is getting set</h2>

<p>Your first question is going to be, am I even toggling the right wire, or
vice versa, am I listening to the right wire?</p>

<p>In the case of a serial port, the line should idle high (at one) when nothing
is being sent.  So anytime the line isn’t one is an event you are interested in,
right?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">ck_uart</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">])</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">o_led</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">];</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You did remember to use two flip flops to synchronize an asynchronous input,
right?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">r_uart</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">i_uart</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">ck_uart</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">r_uart</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Put together, this will turn your LED off if the UART line is ever active. 
Once the character has been sent, the LED should idle high.  (This way you
know the LED works …)  If the LED isn’t
idling high, or if the line never goes low, then you know that you may be
listening to the wrong wire.  If the LED never turns off, you might not
have the right serial port coming out of your computer.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this test usually finds most of the UART problems that take
place using code that passes the simulation test.</p>

<h2 id="check-to-see-if-your-baud-rate-is-set-right">Check to see if your baud rate is set right</h2>

<p>Since the start bit in any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">serial port transaction is always
zero</a>, we should be able
to check for whether or not that first clock stays low for a full baud duration
as follows:</p>

<p>This should help you discover what speed your port is transmitting at.  Just
to check, send an “A” to the port.  Since “A” is represented by 8’d65, which
is an odd number, and since serial ports transmit the
<a href="https://upload.wikipedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/UART_timing_diagram.svg/800px">LSB first</a>, this should
allow you to determine if you are within the baud rate you are expecting.
If “A” doesn’t pass, but “B” does, then you’re baud rate is too slow.</p>

<p>This simple test <em>should</em> find most of the rest of your problems.</p>

<h2 id="check-to-see-if-you-are-discovering-any-characters-at-all">Check to see if you are discovering any characters at all</h2>

<p>At this point, we turn from common and known problems to answering whether
we can debug something … not so well known.  This example tests whether
or not the serial port ever declares that a value has been read (i.e.,
sets rx_stb high for one cycle).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Usually, though, if you’ve passed the simulation test, you’ll never have this
problem.  Still, it can be useful to determine what’s going on.</p>

<p>Did you notice that we kept the bottom 24 bits of this counter counting,
even after the 25th bit went high?  Or the fact that the LED was the AND
of the found light and the 24th counter bit?  In other words, if anything
was found, the light will blink.  If the UART line ever goes active, but
rx_stb never goes high during this time frame, then the LED will stay off.</p>

<h2 id="check-to-see-what-character-you-are-reading">Check to see what character you are reading</h2>

<p>If you know you are receiving a character, but don’t know what it is, then …
use the LED to find out!</p>

<p>Of course, this solution depends upon your being able to display eight data bits
on your LEDs at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-transmitter">What about the transmitter?</h2>

<p>While the examples shown above apply to the UART receiver, there’s no reason
why they cannot be turned around and made to work for the transmitter as well.
You’ll probably want to check the transmitter output in the reverse order,
though: first that it is getting something to send, then whether or not the
baud rate is set right, etc.</p>

<h2 id="possibilities-are-endless">Possibilities are endless</h2>

<p>The number of ways you can set an LED as you work through a problem like
this is endless.  There are just so many tests you can do.</p>

<p>Even still, … this approach has two problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>An LED can only give you one bit of information over the course of a 
  quarter second or so … at best!  If you need more complete information
  about what is going on within your design, getting it out via this means
  will take a long time and may well turn into an exercise in frustration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LED’s can’t tell you what’s happening on a clock by clock basis.  While you
  might be able to build a serial port without knowing this information, on
  anything more complex this approach will become a challenge.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So, stick around–how to use an FPGA to debug itself is the subject of this
blog.</p>
