    <p>The worst place to be in digital design is where you load the design onto your
device, it doesn’t work, and you don’t know why.</p>

<p>I call this: <em>FPGA Hell</em>.</p>

<p>If you find yourself desk-checking your code and not knowing what to look for,
you may be in FPGA Hell.  Weeks and months can spent in there, and you will
make no progress towards your goal while you are there.</p>

<p>Time is money.  FPGA Hell will cost you dearly.  Avoid FPGA Hell at <em>all</em> cost.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>The strategy to get out of FPGA Hell is fairly straightforward.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, simulate everything.  If you don’t have a simulation to describe
the hardware you are working with, make one.</p>

    <p>As an example, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/bench/cpp/uartsim.cpp">here is</a> a simulation of a UART port.  It turns a UART port into either your
standard input and output FILE streams, or into a TCP/IP port that you can
stream your data in and out of.  I built the simulation from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">online
description</a> of how a UART works.  I then use the simulation to debug any Verilog
code someone posts to <a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">Digilent’s forums</a>, but
now that you know my secrets, you can do it too.</p>

    <p>The problem with this first step is: what happens if your understanding of
the device you just built a simulator for doesn’t match reality?  For that,
you need a scope.  Specifically, you need to measure reality and learn what’s
actually happening, and then you need to adjust your simulation to match
reality.  This leads us to the second part of the solution: using a scope.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a scope.  Measure what’s really going on.  Watch your code interact with
the real hardware, and use what you learn to find where reality and your
simulation disconnect.</p>

    <p>A good example of this is my first attempt to build an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">I2C
controller</a>.  For that project, I built
two controllers, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c/blob/master/rtl/wbi2cslave.v">one a
slave</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c/blob/master/rtl/wbi2cmaster.v">the
other a
master</a>.
I then built simulations for both <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c/blob/master/bench/cpp/wbi2cs_tb.cpp">the
slave</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c/blob/master/bench/cpp/wbi2cm_tb.cpp">the
master</a>,
and then worked with the simulations until my code worked.  Once my code
worked, I placed it onto the device and … my code didn’t work.</p>

    <p>To get past the problem, I placed a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/wbscopc.v">scope</a> into my
design, allowing me to “see” what was going on.  What I learned was that the
hardware I was talking to (my monitor) wasn’t doing what I thought it should.
I then had to find <a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">a better
description</a> of how an I2C port
works, rebuild my simulation, get the simulation working again, and then
test on the hardware.</p>

    <p>You can find a discussion of the result, together with pictures of what I was
looking at,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/tree/master/doc/examples/hdmi-eddc">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you cannot use a scope, modify <a href="/blog/2017/05/19/blinky.html">blinky</a> to get the
information you need.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully this helps you avoid FPGA Hell.  If not, watch this space.  I intend
to write more articles here about how to debug an FPGA design and avoid FPGA
Hell.</p>
