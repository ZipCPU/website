  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Now that you have a working <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">serial port</a>
which you can use to interact with your CPU, and now again that you know how to
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/23/simplebus.html">respond to simple bus requests</a>,
let’s examine whether these two be put together to create a simple means of
debugging your FPGA.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll build a generic means for both reading registers
internal to an FPGA using a serial port, and then using that approach to
debug your design.</p>

<h2 id="an-generic-serial-port-communication-interface">An generic serial port communication interface</h2>

<p>For the purpose of this discussion, let’s assume your serial port receiver
produces two outputs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>rx_stb</strong> – a logic value that is true any time a value has been received
across the receive port.  It is to be true for one clock cycle, and one clock
cycle only, any time something is received.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>rx_data</strong> – Eight bits of logic representing the most recently received
data value from the received serial port.  This value has meaning anytime
<strong>rx_data</strong> is true, and ignored at all other times.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Likewise, we’ll assume that your serial port transmitter has two inputs,
<strong>tx_stb</strong> and <strong>tx_data</strong>.  Their meaning will be analogous to that of the
receivers ports.</p>

<p>The advanced student may notice this interface protocol isn’t complete.
In particular, the transmitter may be busy some time <strong>tx_stb</strong> is true, and
nothing above allows us to capture that reality.  To be complete, then, you
will need a third wire, this one coming from your transmit interface:
<strong>tx_busy</strong>.  This wire is true any time the transmitter is busy.  When put
together with the rest of the interface, a character will be accepted into
the transmit interface any time <strong>tx_stb</strong> is true <em>and</em> <strong>tx_busy</strong> is
false.  We’ll ignore this wire for now.  As long as you don’t press this
interface too hard, the approach below will work.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, we can move on to building our basic debug protocol,
based upon this interface to a serial port.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-clock-enable-as-part-of-a-debug-process">Using a Clock Enable as part of a debug process</h2>

<p>The first step is a clock enable line.  I’ll call this <strong>logic_ce</strong> for now,
but you may see me call it <strong>i_ce</strong> later.
We’ll use this clock enable line to gate all of your logic, such as:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">logic_ce</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">begin</span>
		<span class="c1">//
</span>		<span class="c1">// Your debuggable FPGA logic goes here.
</span>		<span class="c1">//
</span>
		<span class="c1">// You could even stuff a full blown CPU in here, if you
</span>		<span class="c1">// wanted to debug it this way.
</span>
		<span class="c1">// Anything that doesn't fit in this always block, will
</span>		<span class="c1">// still need to have it's logic gated by the ce line above.
</span>	<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The goal here is to keep <em>any</em> logic from changing unless the <strong>logic_ce</strong>
line is true.</p>

<p>Why are we doing this?  We’re doing this to slow down your logic to the point
where it can be inspected.</p>

<p>What … how shall this ce line be controlled?<br />
You can use the serial port to control this clock enable.   For this
example, we’ll set the serial port up so that any time you send an
8’h00 across the serial port channel, you also step all the logic by one clock.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">logic_ce</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rx_stb</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rx_data</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mh">8'h00</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Sure, this will <em>really</em> slow down your logic, but … you’ll still be running
<em>your</em> logic on the FPGA.  Where this gets useful is in the next step, reading
data back ouf of the FPGA.</p>

<h2 id="reading-data-back-from-within-your-fpga">Reading data back from within your FPGA</h2>

<p>What really makes this idea flow work, is that now, because of the <em>ce</em> line
above, we can step any logic within the FPGA.  We can then read values back
out of the FPGA while everything is stopped.  Using that UART to control your
bus, you can read out any of your data points with code something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rx_stb</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">begin</span>
		<span class="n">tx_stb</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="k">case</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rx_data</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="mh">8'h00</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">tx_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">8'h00</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="mh">8'h01</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">tx_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">one_of_my_registers</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="mh">8'h02</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">tx_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">another_of_my_registers</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="mh">8'h03</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">tx_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">a_third_set_of_internal_variables</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="o">...</span>
		<span class="mh">8'hff</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">tx_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">the_last_result_i_might_return</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="nl">default:</span> <span class="n">tx_data</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mh">8'h00</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="k">endcase</span>
	<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">else</span>
		<span class="n">tx_stb</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Using this simple approach, you can now read the results of any logic within
your design.  You could also do something similar in the other direction
to set any values within your design if you so wished, but I’ll leave that last
change up to you.</p>

<h2 id="this-really-needs-a-software-controller">This really needs a software controller</h2>

<p>While reading from addresses ‘0’-‘9’ (i.e. 8’d48 to 8’d57) may be pretty
simple, and may be done within a
simple terminal program, chances are that if you wish to make this work you’ll
want to connect a computer program to that terminal program.   That computer
program will need to send the full set of characters from 8’d0 to 8’d255.</p>

<p>You can see how I drive my serial port in the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/sw/host/netuart.cpp">netuart</a>
program I use to
bounce the serial port to a TCP/IP port, but there’s no reason why you couldn’t
use this as an example of how to interact with a serial port.  The commands
would be similar, only the network stuff would need to come out.</p>

<h2 id="multi-stepping">Multi-Stepping</h2>

<p>There’s no reason why you cannot step several steps at a time using this
approach.  You could also set-up multi-cycle instructions that will start
whenever you write a NULL to the port, and whose data may be read after a
programmable number of clocks.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="kt">reg</span>	<span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">rx_stb</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rx_data</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mh">8'h00</span><span class="p">))</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="n">logic_ce</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">NCLOCKS</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span>
		<span class="n">logic_ce</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Indeed, the possibilities of using this approach for debugging are nearly
endless.</p>

<h2 id="output-formats">Output Formats</h2>

<p>If you’d like, you can take the outputs you get from this debugging interface
and build a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump">VCD</a> file for viewing in
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKwave</a>.  If your not sure how to build a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump">VCD</a> file, then just dump
the results into a pseudo-human readable text file and you can then wait
for a later discussion on how to create
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump">VCD</a> files.</p>

<p>Me?  Back when I last used this approach (yes, it was some time ago), I just
created a file that I could view using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">octave</a>.  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a> allowed me to not only read in a set of binary data, but it aso allowed me to create
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKwave</a> types of graphs of the signals within my
design.  Then again, that was a personal choice and you might wish to view
the results in another fashion..</p>

<p>Am I still using this approach?  Not really.  I’ve built something better
since.  Stick around, and you’ll hear about it.  For now, …</p>

<p>Go ahead, take this opportunity to surprise me with your ingenuity.</p>
