    <p>Hello, and welcome to the ZipCPU blog!  This is my first blog post, and so it is
a chance to introduce myself, the ZipCPU, and some of the insights I’ve come 
across while
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/profile/1454-dn/">answering help requests</a>
on the <a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">Digilent forums</a>.</p>

<p>Since this is also my first blog, please feel free to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#122;&#105;&#112;&#099;&#112;&#117;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">write to
me</a> regarding any errors you find in this web-site:
broken links, broken web code, etc.</p>

<p>I am the owner of a small company, Gisselquist Technology, LLC, a services based
company focused on providing superior Computer Engineering and Signal Processing
Services to our customers.  I am also a 20 year veteran of the U.S. Air Force.
While in the Air Force, I sought out and worked on the most difficult
engineering challenges our nation faced.  Now, after a Ph.D. and 20 years of
service, I have focused my energies on the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> and the environment,
toolsuite, and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU">peripherals</a> necessary to support
both it and any customer applications.</p>

<p>I’d like to use this blog to share some of the lessons I have learned over the
years.  These include both Digital Signal Processing topics, as well as FPGA
design topics.  While some of these topics may be self serving, such as how to
set up the ZipCPU, I’d like to address other topics which are often the subject
of Digilent forum requests.  I’m planning on my first topic being <em>how</em> <em>to</em>
<em>debug</em> <em>an</em> <em>FPGA</em> <em>design</em>, especially since so many junior engineering
students writing in to <a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">Digilent’s forums</a>
don’t seem to know how to do that.</p>

<p>Over time, I’d also like to answer the question of how to achieve <a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/4131-just-for-fun-frequency-resolution-challenge/">very clear
frequency resolution</a> when doing FFT processing, or <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/blob/master/tutorial.pdf">how to build
a universal resampler</a>.</p>
