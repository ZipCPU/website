    <p>While I do all my work on a Linux platform, all of the OpenSource tools that I
use can be built and used under Windows just as well as under Linux.</p>

<p>Here’s a set of FPGA tools that can also be used under Windows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> provides an integrated
simulation capability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a> provides a very useful trace
viewing capability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> toolchain also uses:
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils">binutils</a>,
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a>,
<a href="https://sourceware.org/newlib">newlib</a>, and
<a href="http://www.mr511.de/software">libelf</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses">ncurses</a> for creating
textual displays, such as any of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> debuggers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I need a home-made graphical capability, such as an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/sim/verilated/oledsim.cpp">OLEDrgb</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA</a>, or HDMI
simulator, <a href="https://www.gtkmm.org">GTKmm</a> provides me with a nice platform
independent windowing library</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, these might appear to be Linux-only applications.</p>

<p>They aren’t.</p>

<p>They can also run under Windows.</p>

<p>Today, we’ll discuss how to get this toolchain working under Windows.</p>

<h2 id="cygwin-and-how-to-intall-it">CygWin, and how to intall it</h2>

<p><a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> is a program and set of libraries that can be
used on a Microsoft Windows machine to make it look, act, and feel like a
Linux system.</p>

<p>We’ll use <a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> today to give us access to enough of a
Linux environment, so that we can then run
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> install page
<a href="https://cygwin.com/install.html">here</a>.  Go ahead and download the
software appropriate for your computer, whether 32 or 64-bit (if you don’t
know, download the 64-bit version).  Start the installer, and accept the
default configuration options until you get to the package page.</p>

<p>The package page lists all of the programs that can be installed under
<a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>, and it lists them by category.  You might find
it daunting at first—there are a lot of packages to chose from. 
We’ll select the packages here that are necessary
to run <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>,
<a href="https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>, and even the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> compiler/toolchain.  We’ll also
grab some of the packages we may wish to have later in order to install either
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-oledrgb-96-x-64-rgb-led-display-with-16-bit-color-resolution">OLED</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA simulations</a>.  You
may need to use the search facility at the top of
the page to find the following packages–just don’t hit the return key until
you are done.</p>

<p>Here’s our list of packages to enable:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">flex bison libtool make gcc-core gdb ddd ctags colorgcc gperf
libisl-devel libisl-doc libmpfr-devel libmpc-devel libmpc-doc
libgmp-devel libgmp-doc binutils automake autoconf autoconf2.5 automake1.15
libcairomm1.0_1-devel libcairomm1.0_1-doc libcairomm1.0_1
libelf-devel libncurses-devel
aspell-en enscript less source-highlight ghostscript gv
git git-gui subversion patch dos2unix
tcl-devel tcl-tk tcl-tk-devel tcl-iwidgets
gtk-doc libgtk2.0-devel libgtk2.0-doc libgtkmm2.4-doc libgtkmm2.4-devel
libgtk3-doc libgtkmm3.0-doc
xorg-server xorg-server-devel WindowMaker xterm</code></pre></figure>

<p>A lot of these packages have LaTeX based documentation.  If you want to be able
to rebuild that documentation, you may need to download LaTeX as well.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">texinfo texinfo-tex texlive texlive-collection-basic-doc
texlive-collection-latex texlive-collection-latex-doc
texlive-collection-latexextra  texlive-collection-latexextra-doc
texlive-collection-langenglish texlive-collection-pstricks
texlive-collection-pstricks-doc</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you find out later that you missed any packages, just restart the same
<a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> setup program that you just ran, but at that
later time when you know you need more packages.  You can then
repeat the configuration, but when you get to the package screen you can
add any packages you missed as though you were installing them initially.
<a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> will install only the changes, as you would like
it to.  Just … don’t forget where you put the
<a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> installer!</p>

<p>Because we’re going to spend some time working on this machine as well, and
perhaps even need to do some real work, let’s add in some of my favorite
Linux packages to work with:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">hexchat putty gnome-terminal screen gvim meld
octave octave-devel octave-doc gnuplot
dia dia-shapes inkscape</code></pre></figure>

<p>These are my favorite editor, <em>gvim</em>,
my favorite code-comparison tool, <em>meld</em>,
my favorite IRC client, <em>hexchat</em>,
and my favorite screen multiplexer, <em>screen</em>.
Also included in this list is <em>octave</em>, a free and open source package
offering a Matlab-like capability,
and <em>dia</em>, a program for making quick vector graphics diagrams. 
I personally like <em>dia</em>.  However you may find that you not only like
<em>inkspace</em> better, but also that it is better maintained.</p>

<p>While all of these may not be needed, this was the set I used to prove the
toolsuite I use.</p>

<p>Once <a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> finishes installing, it’ll ask you if you
wish to place a cygwin icon on the desktop and in your start menu.  I
chose to accept the default, which was to say “yes” to both.  Then, to start
up the <a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> environment, you can just double click
on the <a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> icon that should now be on your desktop.
That will bring up a terminal window that we can then use for our next steps.</p>

<p>Indeed, we are not done yet.  Though we have <a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
installed, <a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> didn’t come with all of our favorite
packages, or the packages we need.  Specifically, neither
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> nor
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a> were on
<a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>’s list.  So, we’ll have to go back and get them
separately.</p>

<h2 id="installing-verilator">Installing Verilator</h2>

<p>The first FPGA support package to get is
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.  We’ll start by grabbing
the sources for <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
from a tarball found on <a href="https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Installing">this
page</a>.  In my
case, that tarball was named <em>verilator-3.904.tgz</em>.</p>

<p>The instructions for installing
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>, also found on that
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Installing">same page</a>,
are fairly simple.  At your command line, type:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">unset VERILATOR_ROOT
tar xvzf verilator*.t*gz
cd verilator*
./configure
make
sudo make install</code></pre></figure>

<p>Much to my surprise, this worked without any hassles.  (I was expecting things
to be harder.)</p>

<h2 id="installing-gtkwave">Installing GTKWave</h2>

<p>The next program we’ll install is <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>.
We’ll use this program later to view any traces <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">created by
simulations</a>
we might run and try.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a> on it’s
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">sourceforge website</a>.  On their front page,
they have a link to a source tarball.  In my case, that tarball was named
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/gtkwave-3.3.81.tar.gz">gtkwave-3.3.81.tar.gz</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll download this tarball and place it into our
<a href="https://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> home directory.  Once done, we can build
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a> simply with:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">tar -xvzf gtkwave-3.3.81.tar.gz
cd gtkwave-3.3.81/
./configure --disable-xz
make install</code></pre></figure>

<p>At this point, we’re <em>almost</em> ready to try it.  One step remains.  We need to
start up the X-server.  We’ll start the server, and then start a window manager
(wmaker) and an xterm.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">X &amp;
wmaker -display :0 &amp;
xterm -display :0 &amp;</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will create a large window on the display, and place a terminal within
it.  We can now simulate something with
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>,
and then display it from this window using
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-serial-port-test">Running a Serial Port Test</h2>

<p>Now that we have everything installed, we need something to test to prove that
this install works.</p>

<p>Perhaps the easiest package to test, and the package that offers a complete
end-to-end test case without requiring anything else,
is the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">wbuart32</a> serial
port package.  This package contains a complete <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/rtl/wbuart.v">wishbone controlled UART
peripheral</a>,
together with some <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/tree/master/bench/verilog">self-contained testing
programs</a>–such
as <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/bench/verilog/helloworld.v">Hello World</a>.</p>

<p>To run this test, we’ll first clone the git repository,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">git clone https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32</code></pre></figure>

<p>and then we’ll change into the new directory we’ve just created.  From here,
we can build the distro.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd wbuart32 ; make</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will also run a UART simulation test, just to prove that the package
works.</p>

<p>Once the build and test bench have completed, we’ll move into the C++ test
directory and run the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/bench/cpp/helloworld.cpp">Hello
World</a>
program on its own.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cd bench/cpp
./helloworld</code></pre></figure>

<p>If all works well, you should see the “Hello, World!” characters printed
across your screen, and then the program should exit.</p>

<p>Now if you look in your directory (type ‘ls’), you should be able to find a
“helloworld.vcd” file.  This is a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump">value-change-dump</a> type of
file, that contains
the value of every variable as it existed on every clock cycle within the
simulation we just ran.  Not bad, huh?</p>

<p>Let’s start up <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">gtkwave helloworld.vcd</code></pre></figure>

<p>and take a look at what we can find.</p>

<p>If you’ve never used
<a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a> before, stay with me.
When I first started using <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a>,
the opening screen left me confused.  It
was big and black with green lines and … didn’t do anything.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1: GTKWave, your first click</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/cygwin/gtkwave-firstclick.png" alt="Step one with gtkwave" width="240" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Now that I’ve used it for some time, I no longer find it so confusing.  Just
go over to the left side of the screen.  There, in the top of two white panel’s,
will be the name of our top level module, TOP, with a plus beside it.  Go ahead
and click on it (the word TOP, not the plus yet).</p>
<table style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 2: GTKWave, drag items to view</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/cygwin/gtkwave-firstdrag.png" alt="Dragging waveforms to view in GTKWave" width="240" /></td></tr></table>
<p>You’ll then see, listed in
the small panel below, all of the external I/O ports associated with our
design.  Let’s use the mouse to grab the clock register, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_clk</code>
and drag it to the display area.  Next, let’s grab the output serial port
register, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_uart</code>, and drag that to the display as well.</p>

<p>Ok, so now you’ve got two green lines in the display.  We can do one better.</p>

<p>While holding the control key down, scroll with the mouse wheel.  Go ahead
and scroll out until you see the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_uart</code> field changing.  You can then
move over to it and control scroll zoom-in and see what we just did, or simply
use the scroll button to move left or right in time.  Doing this, you should
be able to see the waveform shown in Fig. 3 below.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3: GTKWave: Hello World</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/cygwin/gtkwave-hello.png" alt="Hello World UART output in GTKWave" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>You can view other variables as well.  Just go back to that “TOP” value in
the upper left pane and click on the plus.  This will bring up the next
level down in your design.  You can then drag any the variables you are
interested in into the main green window and see how they line up with
the serial port and clock wires that we already added in.</p>

<p>We’ll have to leave for another time, though, the further details of what’s
going on.  This is enough for the day as it is.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-the-simulator">The power of the simulator</h2>

<p>Before closing, let me just ask: do you realize the significance of what we’ve
just done?  We’ve just
ran a simulator as though it were a real FPGA.  The simulator talked to a
console port, just like any real serial port connected to an FPGA might have
done.  The great point here is that you can learn a lot about what it takes
to build and run logic using this simulator!</p>

<p>Sure, it’s not quite the same thing as the real thing.  A real FPGA has
limits on the amount of logic that can take place between two clock pulses.
A real FPGA has a finite number of resources that can be assigned to your
logic.  A real FPGA would also need to match the baud rate on your terminal
program.  Still, simulation is one of the big things that will keep you from
<a href="/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>, and we’ve just shown you how
you can simulate a serial port.</p>
