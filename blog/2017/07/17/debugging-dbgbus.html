  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So, my thought from last week was that I might be able to post something about
using push-buttons on an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>,
and the problems they struggle with. 
Specifically, I wanted to discuss
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bouncing</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">debugging bus</a>
<a href="/blog/2017/06/29/sw-dbg-interface.html">we just created</a>
provides the perfect environment for evaluating button
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bouncing</a>,
and so I started to put a post together on the topic.  But … I
wanted to add something more on the topic beyond what I had read of this
phenomena.  I wanted to add scope/traces of signals
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bouncing</a>,
and even share the code so that anyone could download it and try it and see
how their own development board responded when a button was pressed.</p>

<p>Sounds neat, right?</p>

<p>But doing this required I run the debugging
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/bench/rtl/testbus.v">test bus</a>
(with modifications for catching
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce">bouncing</a>
components), on my hardware.  In this case, I was going to use the <a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/arty-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists">Digilent
Arty</a>,
for a demonstration,
although the test should run on any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>,
with a UART and I may try out some
others to see if the button performance I am getting is any different.</p>

<p>My first surprise came when I tried building the new/modified project
using Vivado: I was quickly reminded that things that work with
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
may not always always work with your build tools.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-different">What was different</h2>

<p>I found a couple differences between
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> and Vivado this week:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
doesn’t detect when a wire (or register) is being set in multiple places.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
can’t always tell the difference between wires and registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of a third difference as well: in Xilinx, all unspecified flip
flops start initially with a value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>. 
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
starts with what appears to be random values.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Given that <a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> is an open
source project, and that posts on the web (like this one) seem to live forever,
these differences may be gone by the time you read this post.</p>

<p>I’ve since <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/commits/master">updated</a> the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">debugging bus project</a> with these changes,
so that it now works.  I also found a bug or two in the software support.  Those
have also been changed, and so the whole now works on real hardware (i.e., on
my <a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/arty-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists">Digilent
Arty</a>).</p>

<p>If you’d like to see the changes, please feel free to browse the project’s
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/commits/master">GitHub log</a>.
There you’ll find a set of six changes that were made to the debugging bus
in order to get it to synthesize and work.</p>

<h2 id="i-still-love-verilator">I still love Verilator</h2>

<p>These differences aren’t deterring me from using
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.
How could they?
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
still finds most of the bugs in any design in the time it takes Vivado
to <em>start</em> synthesizing my code.  It can also find bugs that Vivado doesn’t
find (bus width mis-match, for example).  So I still love
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.</p>

<p>My point is that, as of today, it doesn’t find everything.  Things that work in
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>
will <em>usually</em> work in your hardware, but not always.</p>

<p>But … that’s one of the purposes of a
<a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">logic scope</a>, right? 
Such a scope will help you debug what’s going on within your design when the
simulation and the hardware don’t act the same.</p>
