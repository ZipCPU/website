  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Every now and then, the <a href="">ZipCPU blog</a> includes a short
discussion on engineering ethics.  Our last post challenged you with the
question, <a href="/blog/2017/08/12/caused-to-lie.html">what would cause you to
lie</a>?  Below is a
discussion from some of my own experience, illustrating the extent to which
an integrity problem can destroy the foundation of solid engineering.</p>

<p>Before I started <a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist
Technology</a>,
I had my own moral strength and integrity challenged.</p>

<p>Many years ago, I was asked to join the government team managing a
multibillion dollar contract.  To protect the innocent, we’ll leave the name
of the project and the name of the office supporting it nameless.  Suffice
to say that I was working for a government procurement office.</p>

<p>The director of my office asked me to examine the product that he was
responsible for procuring on behalf of the US government.  I was not asked
because it was my current job (I had been working on another team), but
rather
because of some heated disagreements over whether or not the product actually
worked.  Since my academic background was in a nearly related field, I was
deemed to be uniquely suited to evaluate the product that was being produced.</p>

<h2 id="what-my-research-revealed">What my research revealed</h2>

<p>As I started researching this program, its requirements and history, I quickly
discovered that the history of the program was quite colored.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Liar's Dilemma</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/integrity-big-money-liars-dilemma.svg" alt="The liar's dilemma" width="320" /></td></tr></table>
<p>Interviews with the contractor revealed a history of employees getting
re-assigned or fired for telling the government procurement lead that the
product didn’t or wouldn’t work.  Those that remained, the ones I was able to
talk to, were very aware that remaining on the contract, indeed their very
job and livelihood, would only be possible if they said nothing about any
problems the system had.</p>

<p>Those who worked for the contractor were both scared and morally scarred.
They were living under a lie and they knew it and didn’t like it.  However,
they felt trapped.  If they spoke up, they knew that they lose their jobs
and how would they then feed their family?</p>

<p>The corruption wasn’t limited to the one office.  Rather, it spread throughout
the contractor’s facility, throughout the government procurement office, and
even into the leadership of those who were supposed to use this product.</p>

<p>For example, all of the official program briefs presented glowing numbers
showing the amount of data the system could process.  The quantity was
deemed to make the program a success.  The program manager was very quick
to display all kinds of figures showing the massive amounts of data this
system produced.  However, he had no means of proving that any one of those
outputs were in fact correct.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Two views of whether or not the system worked</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/integrity-big-money-does-it-work.svg" alt="Does it work?" width="680" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The actual user’s of the program, on the other hand, would present example
upon example demonstrating
the failures of the program.  However, without maintaining the data set that
created those failures, the failures could never be reproduced.  Since the
failures couldn’t be reproduced, they couldn’t be used as test cases and formed
ambiguous requests for improvement within the program office.  Further,
since the system was never tested against known inputs in conditions similar
to those that had caused known failures, it was impossible to know if the
failures were common behaviors, or just the one in a million rare example.</p>

<p>The result was that any time the two offices got together, the meetings
could easily devolve into shouting matches.  It works!  It’s broken!
With no truth under-girding either argument, the two sides might just as well
have been arguing: <a href="http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/63816024">Taste’s great!  Less
filling!</a>  There would have
been no difference in the result.</p>

<p>This is the sad result of what happens when sound engineering practice is
abandoned.</p>

<p>Rather than treating this as the integrity problem it was, the problem was
officially characterized as “political”.  By management fiat, I was instructed
and told that the problem had nothing to do with sound engineering practice.</p>

<p>However, the problem was not “political” as my boss had instructed me.  The
problem was the result of the loss of the Godly integrity that forms the
foundation of sound engineering practice.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Does it work?</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/integrity-big-money-venn.svg" alt="A Venn Diagram of Performance" width="360" /></td></tr></table>
<p>In the digital design world, we might say that the project didn’t include
any representative test-benches.  How was it tested, you ask, without
test-benches?  By comparing the system’s results before any software changes
to the results after the improvements.  But … which of those results were
actually correct?  No one knew.</p>

<p>No one was placing known inputs into the device to measure whether or not it
was producing the correctly expected outputs.  This is the idea behind a
“ground truth” test.  Known inputs are measured against what should be known
outputs.  Differences are recorded, quantified, and reported on.</p>

<h2 id="ground-truth-testing">Ground truth testing</h2>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>A Ground Truth Test</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/integrity-big-money-ground-truth.svg" alt="Ground truth methodology outline" width="680" /></td></tr></table>

<p>A “ground truth” testing program that compared the output of this product
against an expected or “correct” output was called for.  Further, a library
of “ground truth” test cases having known inputs needed to be assembled that
would highlight any problems, and also allow the development team to fix
them.  The program basically needed test benches with physically realistic
inputs.</p>

<p>With this goal in mind, I quickly assembled a small team and secured funding
for a project that would help to determine how the system actually performed
against known inputs.  We called it a “ground truth” testing program.  To my
surprise, the idea of “ground truth” testing program was not universally
acclaimed as good engineering.  Indeed, it was my own office that
considered the idea “controversial.”  I was told that such testing would be
a waste of precious dollars, and that it wouldn’t prove anything to those
that “didn’t like” the system.</p>

<p>While this “ground truth” testing program was underway, a senior leadership
“taskforce” was appointed to fix all the system’s problems.  Management gave
them ninety days to be successful.  Reality,
though, is that years of engineering integrity problems are not easily fixed
in ninety days.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Project Timelines</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/integrity-big-money-timeline.svg" alt="A timeline showing events" width="680" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Think about that one: what would you do if <em>you</em> were the one appointed to
a ninety day task force, and tasked with fixing problems that were the
result of years of integrity neglect?</p>

<p>While I was not personally involved in this “taskforce”, I read with great
interest their results and conclusions.</p>

<p>Much as one might expect, the “taskforce” declared the system fixed.
Had they compared the output of the system against known inputs?  No.</p>

<p>Did the “task force” collect examples of inputs causing “known failures”,
apply fixes, and then run those same examples again to see if the result
got better?
No.  They applied fixes and tested the system with new data which may or may
not have had the original problem within it.  There was no
way to know if the fixes even worked.  Indeed, all those who weren’t
part of the senior leadership team were instructed to accept that the
problems had been fixed–independent of any real facts.</p>

<p>This is not how you fix such a system.</p>

<p>What the “task force” should have done would have been to first find data sets
that would have reproduced the problems, and then replayed those data sets
through the system later to see if any of the “fixes” worked.  Further,
their data sets needed to come with known answers–such as the “ground truth”
testing approach was working to create.</p>

<p>When I saw the results of this senior leadership “taskforce”, I spoke up.  I
sent an internal memo to the rest of the procurement team outlining how the
process was broken.  I explained that the senior leadership “taskforce” hadn’t
demonstrated that they had fixed anything, since they had abandoned sound
engineering practice.  As I’m sure you can imagine, my office manager wasn’t
pleased with my views.  When he read this memo, he then called me into his
office and threatened me.  “You pull another stunt like this, and you will be
fired.”</p>

<p>During this time, the ground truth testing effort continued.</p>

<p>To illustrate how bad the environment was at the contractor’s facility,
they were making bets over when the ground truth project was going to be
killed by my management (in the procurement office).</p>

<p>The procurement management team never liked the “ground truth” testing
approach, probably because they didn’t feel like they could control it’s
results.  Measurements are pesky things, and comparisons between system
outputs and known “correct” answers are hard to spin.  Indeed, the “ground
truth” testing project was nearly terminated once when the procurement
manager, whom I worked for, realized what I was up to.  (It was also nearly
terminated when he read the memo I referenced above.)</p>

<p>As you might expect, testing a product in a way that it has never been tested
before will likely yield unexpected results.  This is normal.  This was the
result of the “ground truth” tests.</p>

<p>The product itself was not irreversibly broken.  Sound engineering process,
built upon true engineering and integrity, would’ve fixed it.  The real
problem was that no one was using sound engineering principles because of the
lies and the fear involved.  True God given engineering integrity had been
lost.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when the procurement manager read the “ground truth” report,
he didn’t like its results.  He then directed me to withhold these results
from the people who were going to use this product.</p>

<h2 id="the-aftermath">The aftermath</h2>

<p>This was about where the office’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Inspector_General_(United_States)">Inspector General (IG)</a> got involved.</p>

<p>This was also the point where I learned the legal definition of the word
“fraud”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fraud is generally defined in the law as an intentional misrepresentation
of material existing fact made by one person
to another with knowledge of its falsity and for the
purpose of inducing the other person to act,
and upon which the other person relies with resulting injury
or damage.  Fraud may also be made by an omission or purposeful failure
to state material facts, which nondisclosure makes other statements
misleading.  <a href="https://definitions.uslegal.com/fraud">uslegal.com</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s break this down into simpler terms.  I had created for my office a
“material fact”: the ground truth testing report.  By withholding this
fact from the operations office (fraud by omission) that was supposed to
accept our product, they had suffered “damage”: they were forced to accept
as operational a system that never passed a valid test.  This met the
legal definition of fraud.</p>

<p>Following the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Inspector_General_(United_States)">IG</a>’s
report, the program had a change of leadership.  Some individuals lost their
jobs.  Several individuals were quietly forced to retire.  I was also given my
one and only chance to brief the US Congress.  I would have rather had my
opportunity under more pleasurable circumstances.  However, I knew my duty.</p>

<p>I also chose to leave that community and seek other work, so as to avoid
any ethical or whistle-blower issues.</p>

<p>Since then, I have kept up with members of contractor’s office.  I have
thus kept track of what has happened after my departure.  A new management
team has been assigned to replace the old.  The new management team, though,
kept the same advisors from the last team.  The sad result is that the old
advisors convinced them to follow the same crooked path that had led them
into the mess in the first place.  As a result, this product is still built
upon lies, having no sound engineering integrity within it.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-the-liars-dilemma">Breaking the Liar’s Dilemma</h2>

<p>Throughout this whole process, I would constantly explain to my team that
your actions should all depend upon your judge.  If the boss is your judge,
do as he tells you to do.  If the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Inspector_General_(United_States)">IG</a>
or Congress will be your judge, act so as to impress them.  On the otherhand,
if anticipate that God will be your judge, then don’t worry about the boss, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Inspector_General_(United_States)">IG</a>,
or Congress: focus your life on pleasing God.</p>

<p>What about the liar’s dilemma?</p>

<p>Jesus provides some clear guidance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we
drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these things
do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have
need of all these things.  But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought
for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/6/33">Matt 6:31-34</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, this guidance breaks the trap of the liar’s dilemma.  In this verse,
Jesus promises that God will provide and all we need to do is to “seek first
the kingdom of God”.  The big problem with the liar’s dilemma is that
those caught within it believe that their life will be worse, if not even
destroyed, if they do not lie.  Yet for those willing to trust Jesus at His
word, they will learn that this is never the case.</p>

<p>I read these verses many times during my work on this project.</p>

<p>Yes, I have left that job and that twisted work environment.  No, I am not
making the “big bucks” today, but I did manage to leave with my integrity.
Thanks be to God.</p>
