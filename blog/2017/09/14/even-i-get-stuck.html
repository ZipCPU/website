    <p><a href="https://zipcpu.com/">This site</a> is dedicated to keeping
students and other digital design developers
out of <a href="/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>: that state in the design
process where your design doesn’t work, and you have absolutely no clue why
not.</p>

<p>I’d like to present myself
as immune from ever having that problem.  How else shall I be respected as a
teacher of others who can teach students how to avoid this problem?</p>

<p>Today, though, I have a confession to make: I get stuck in
<a href="/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a> from time to time as well.</p>

<p>By the grace of the Almighty, I’ve recently received three reprieves, so that I
can now tell you both how I got stuck, and how I got unstuck.</p>

<h2 id="hdmi-video">HDMI Video</h2>

<p><strong>The background</strong>:
One of my ongoing projects is an HDMI Video project.  This project has two
components.  The first is the receiver.  This component is supposed to
receive an HDMI signal and stuff the pixels into memory.  The second
component is the transmitter.  This component is supposed to read an image
frame from memory, and transmit it to my monitor.  The ultimate goal of this
project is to be able to process the HDMI signals associated with
3D head-sets, such as the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift/">Oculus Rift</a>.</p>

<p>I’m doing my development on a
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/">Nexys-Video board</a>.  This board has not only the required
HDMI input and output ports, but also enough memory to tackle the data
transfer.  (We can talk later about memory bandwidth, which for this
application will require some creative solutions.)</p>

<p>I had the project working some time ago to the point where I could lock on to
the received HDMI signal and calculate it’s pixel clock rate, frame rate,
and even the number of lines per frame, pixels per line, horizontal sync
length, vertical sync length, front porches, back porches, etc.  In other
words, from the incoming data, I can calculate all of the required video
parameters to set an associated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86_Modeline">mode
line</a>.</p>

<p>I can also read and process the EDID information using the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">wbi2c</a> project.</p>

<p>Then I tore the project apart so that I could incorporate the
512MB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">DDR3 SDRAM</a>
memory into the design.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1: Broken HDMI</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/hdmi-bug.svg" alt="HDMI input bug" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p><strong>The symptoms</strong>: Since finishing the restructuring changes necessary to get
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">DDR3 SDRAM</a> memory to work,
I hadn’t been able to get the incoming video to
lock at all, and I’ve been struggling to figure out what was wrong.
Fig 1 shows my test setup.  I was using my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone
scope</a> to capture frames of video
data.  I could then use these with a home-made HDMI simulator to
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">simulate my
code</a>.
The resulting code just didn’t contain the synchronization pattern that I
knew was there.  The data was somehow wrong, but I just couldn’t figure
out what logical transformation would correct it.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong>: Just this week, I figured out what was going on.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 2: Broken HDMI bug found</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/hdmi-bug-found.svg" alt="HDMI input bug found" width="380" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Since adding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">SDRAM</a>,
I had changed my system clock from the incoming
100MHz clock rate, to the 100MHz clock used by the Xilinx MIG generated
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">SDRAM</a>
controller.  (I’d still like to use my own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">DDR3 SDRAM</a> controller,
but <a href="http://opencores.org/project,wbddr3">that project</a> is currently on
hold.)  This controller clock is subtly different from the 100MHz input clock,
even though the two are at the same frequency: it takes some time for the PLL
to settle, and there’s a phase difference due to the distribution network.
(These are only the differences I know of.)</p>

<p>You can see what the broken configuration looked like in Fig 2.</p>

<p>These differences were apparently enough that a reset line I was setting with
logic on the 100MHz clock, was failing to reset the ISERDESE2 component on the
148.5MHz HDMI pixel clock.</p>

<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3: Broken HDMI bug fixed</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/hdmi-bug-fixed.svg" alt="HDMI input bug fixed" width="380" /></td></tr></table>

<p><strong>How did I find the problem?</strong>  The worst way to find a problem like this is
by desk-checking your code.  It is, however, how I ended up finding it.  I
knew, from pixel captures, that the problem had to be in the ISERDESE2
component.  I had traced it there via my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a>.  Then, thanks to the
Almighty, in one sudden piece of inspiration I realized the problem.</p>

<p>The code in question now includes an asynchronous reset, with a synchronous
release, such as is shown in Fig 3.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="kt">wire</span>		<span class="n">async_reset</span><span class="o">;</span>

<p>I also added a separate piece of logic to “synchronize” the CE signal to
the HDMI pixel clock:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="kt">wire</span>		<span class="n">lcl_ce</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="kt">reg</span>	<span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>	<span class="n">syncd_ce</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">syncd_ce</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">syncd_ce</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">i_ce</span> <span class="o">};</span>
<span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">lcl_ce</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">syncd_ce</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These two changes fixed the problem.</p>

<p>This, by the way, is one of those reasons why
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_electronics">metastability</a>
can be so problematic.  The symptoms of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_electronics">metastability</a>
tend not to make any sense.  They draw you away from looking for
clock domain transfer problems, convincing you that your logic is somehow
strangely at fault.  In the end, I’ve only ever found
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_electronics">metastability</a>
and other clock-domain crossing related problems by desk-checking my code.
(If you know of another way, please feel free to share …)</p>

<h2 id="ico-board-parallel-port">ICO Board Parallel Port</h2>

<p><strong>The background</strong>:
The second problem I was struggling with was on my
<a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO Board</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">project</a>.  The
<a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO Board</a> is designed to demonstrate the utility of
a full open-source tool-chain for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
development.  It is based upon an
ICE40
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
with <a href="http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/225/iCE40FamilyHandbook-311139.pdf">8k logic
gates</a>.
My goal with this project was to create a series of beginner demonstration
designs that others could reference.  Indeed, the board was given to me by
the project team as a gift for that purpose.</p>

<p>My problem was that I’ve been struggling to get a
<a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">debugging bus</a>
running over the parallel port between the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
and the
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry Pi</a>
for some time.</p>

<p>You can see how far I had gotten in Fig 4 below.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4: Broken IcoZip Project</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ico-bug.svg" alt="ICO parallel port" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p><strong>The symptoms</strong>: The bus worked fine in simulation, but somehow struggled any
time I tried to actually place it on the board.  I placed an extra
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-8ld-eight-high-brightness-leds">8-LEDs</a>
onto the board, but still couldn’t figure out what was going wrong.
In particular, I couldn’t tell if it was that the
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry Pi</a>
was talking too fast, or whether something was wrong within the
<a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO Board</a>.  At one time I was afraid I was creating
a short across the parallel port interface, and so somehow the
<a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO Board</a> was losing power in the middle of a
transaction.</p>

<p>I even went so far as to connect a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-usbuart-usb-to-uart-interface/">PMod
USBUART</a>
to the board, so that I could use <em>a known working
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">debug-bus</a></em>,
based upon my <em>proven <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART</a></em> code,
to find the fault, and … even my proven code didn’t work right.</p>

<p><strong>How did I find the problem?</strong>  In this case, a heart-felt thank you goes
out to both the Almighty, and to the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>
sales team, who were looking for some feedback on their <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/digital-discovery-portable-logic-analyzer-and-digital-pattern-generator/">Digital
Discovery</a>
device, shown in Fig 5.</p>
<table style="float: right"><caption>Fig 5: A Digital Discovery logic analyzer</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/digital-discovery-top-130.png" alt="Digilent's Digital Discovery" width="280" /></td></tr></table>
<p>Out of the blue, they asked if I’d like to review the
device for them, and send them back my thoughts.  Of course I’d be interested,
I said.</p>

<p>If you aren’t familiar with the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/digital-discovery-portable-logic-analyzer-and-digital-pattern-generator/">Digital Discovery</a>
it’s an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
based external
logic analyzer.
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a> sells the device for $200 USD.
It boasts the ability to capture and analyze data signals at up to 800MHz.
However, my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">ICO board design</a> was only
running at <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/auto-data/clock.txt">40MHz–a slow clock
rate</a> since I
couldn’t tell what was wrong with the design, and I wasn’t certain
how well I could trust my
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm">timing analyzer</a>.  (In the end, the timing
analyzer wasn’t the problem, and I could’ve trusted the
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm">icestorm tools</a> just fine.)</p>

<p>To use this device, I connected one of the PMod ports of the
<a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO Board</a> to the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/digital-discovery-portable-logic-analyzer-and-digital-pattern-generator/">Digital Discovery</a>,
and started making and examining captures.</p>

<p>One particular capture showed one of my logic signals holding a value for
less than 10ns.  This didn’t make any sense, since the clock period was
<em>supposed</em> to be 25ns.  Further, it didn’t make sense as a spurious value that
hadn’t yet settled yet, since the design then continued as though this
value had been high for a full clock cycle.  (To the extent that I could
tell anything about what this erratic design was doing …)  That left me
wondering what the actual clock rate was, so I decided to dump the system
clock to one of the output pins and examine it.</p>

<p>You can see the final test setup in Fig 5 below.  It was enough to see
the problem.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 5: IcoZip Problem found</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ico-bug-found.svg" alt="IcoZip problem found" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>:
As with the HDMI problem, this problem also turned out to
be clock related.  In this case, I had given the wrong parameters to the
<a href="http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/225/iCE40FamilyHandbook-311139.pdf">iCE40</a>’s
<a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=47778">PLL</a>
primitive.  Sure, I read through
<a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=47778">the manual</a>,
but
<a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=47778">the manual</a>
didn’t explain all of the configuration parameters very well.  As a result, I
hadn’t set all of the PLL parameters correctly.  The <a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=47778">iCE40
documentation</a>,
recommends using their
proprietary wizard.  However, since I never managed to get their proprietary
software installed, I was using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">open
source</a>
<a href="https://www.clifford.at/yosys">yosys toolchain</a> instead and
instantiating the primitive directly.</p>

<p>The result was that the
<a href="http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/225/iCE40FamilyHandbook-311139.pdf">iCE40</a>’s
<a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=47778">PLL</a>
primitive (SB_PLL) wasn’t locking, and so my system clock was unstable.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found the
<a href="https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm/tree/master/icepll">icepll</a>
open-source program which told me what the
<a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=47778">PLL</a>
parameters needed to be set to in order to get a stable clock.</p>

<p>Now that I have my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/master/hexbus">debugging bus</a>
up and running within my <a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO Board</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">project</a> over the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/tree/master/pport">parallel port</a>,
I can now start to add (and debug) other capabilities.  This will include
the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
implementation for the board, the SRAM, as well as (hopefully) the flash on
the board.  My goal is to get the point where I can play
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/tttt">4x4x4 tic-tac-toe</a>
on the board, using only the
<a href="https://sourceware.org/newlib/">standard C-library</a>.
Others, I imagine, will be more interested in the extensibility offered by an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
based platform making it easy to add and remove functionality from the design.</p>

<h2 id="arbitrary-clock-rate-generator">Arbitrary clock rate generator</h2>

<p><strong>The background</strong>:
The third design that I got stuck on is an arbitrary clock rate generator.
This is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
only design, requiring no external clock, save only the 100MHz clock already
provided to the board.  It is also one of those designs that demonstrates
something few people think possible–the ability to create a suitable
clock signal from logic alone.</p>

<p>Indeed, I wasn’t certain if it was possible myself.</p>

<p>For those interested, the design is based upon the <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/generating-timing.html">logic presented
here</a>.
Using that logic, together with the input 100MHz clock, I can request a clock
frequency within 0.2Hz or so of any desired clock frequency, and then create
a clock that accurately matches that frequency.  Further, if I use the <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-gps-gps-receiver">PMod
GPS</a>,
I should be able to generate a clock frequency with absolutely stability at
any known frequency.  (“Should be able to” means I haven’t tried to yet.)</p>

<p>As with the HDMI project above, the hardware I was using was the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/">Nexys-Video board</a>.</p>

<p>My goal with this project was to be able to create an output pixel clock,
to be sent via the HDMI output port, of an arbitrary frequency so that it
could support any reasonable display timing.</p>

<table style="float: none"><caption>Fig 6: Broken arbitrary clock generator</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/genclk-bug.svg" alt="Broken arbitrary clock generator" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Normally, I wouldn’t think twice if this design didn’t work.
It requires that I can get my hardware to work in a way that it wasn’t designed
to work in, and so I was never certain it could work in the first place.
However, the first time I fired up the design it appeared to work.  Then, after
making several changes (without git backups), I lost that appearance of
working and …  I struggled to understand why.</p>

<p>Indeed, the clock would appear to lock onto frequencies such as 50MHz, 75MHz,
100MHz, 125MHz, and so forth, but never lock onto the frequency I was
requesting, such as 131.415928MHz.</p>

<p>I was stuck.  I desk-checked and desk-checked my code.  I read through
the Xilinx clocking guide.  I found and fixed several “problems”, but never
fixed <em>the</em> problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Definition: <strong>Voodoo computing</strong>.
A noun describing the process of fixing what isn’t broken in an attempt to
find and fix what is.  It is usually characterized by a complete lack of
understanding as to what is causing the problem, and so the “fixes” applied
tend to be quite irrelevant to the actual problem at hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How did I find the problem</strong>:  In this case, I turned again to the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/digital-discovery-portable-logic-analyzer-and-digital-pattern-generator/">Digital Discovery</a>.
As with the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">icozip</a> project, I routed my
generated clock signal to a PMod port.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, my code wasn’t generating the clock that I thought it
was generating.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong>:  This sent me back to my clock generation code, where I was
able to find the problem.  In this case, my problem was associated
with the Xilinx OSERDESE2 primitive.  The primitive was mis-configured.
(I had set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">DATA_RATE_TQ</code> parameter to “DDR” instead of “SDR”, for a
functionality <em>I wasn’t using</em>.)  Once fixed, the whole design started working.</p>

<p>As a result, I can now create arbitrary clock frequencies within my
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/">Nexys-Video board</a>, without requiring any additional
hardware.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In each of these examples, the easiest part of the design to get right was the
logic.  The hardest part, the part which had sent me to
<a href="/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a> in the first place,
was dealing with those parts and components of my design which I could not
simulate.  Further, in two out of three of these examples, an external logic
analyzer,
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>’s
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/digital-discovery-portable-logic-analyzer-and-digital-pattern-generator/">Digital Discovery</a>,
rescued me.</p>

<p>My point, though, is simply this: even those who have been designing digital
logic for years can still get stuck.  If you work with an old hand, ask for
some of their stories over lunch time.  You might find that lunch can actually
be entertaining—without discussing either religion or politics.</p>

<p>Perhaps next time I’ll know to check the PLL-locked output signal, though,
rather than assuming that any PLL will always lock.</p>

<p>The code for all three projects is available for those sufficiently
interested.  The
<a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO Board</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">project</a>, together with its
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/tree/master/hexbus">debugging bus</a>
and support infrastructure, can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">Github</a>.
The clock generation core is available upon request for any of my
Patreon sponsors who supports me for $10 USD or more, and will probably be
eventually included within the HDMI video project.  It’s not well documented
(yet), but with sufficient interest in it that can be changed.  (It’s only
about 300 lines of code or so …)</p>

<p>The HDMI video project, though, needs sponsors in order to bring it to
completion.  It still needs more development work
before it will be released on <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU">Github</a>, and that
work isn’t (yet) paid for.  If you are interested in this project, please
consider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">supporting me on Patreon</a>, and then
sending me a note to let me know that it is a project you are interested in.</p>
