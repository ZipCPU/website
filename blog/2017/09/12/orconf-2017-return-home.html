    <p>Just a quick post today to thank the individuals who made
<a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a> this year
such a great success!  The staff did a wonderful job setting up the conference,
and I learned a <em>lot</em> from all those present with whom I had a chance to talk.</p>

<p>When it came my turn, I presented both an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/doc/orconf2017.pdf">update on the
ZipCPU</a>, as
well as <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/blob/master/doc/orconf17.pdf">telling everyone about
AutoFPGA</a>.
I’ve also posted the final slides for both projects on line, in case you
weren’t able to go and would like to see what I presented.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/doc/orconf2017.pdf">ZipCPU update
slides can be found
here</a>,
whereas the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/blob/master/doc/orconf17.pdf">AutoFPGA slides can be found
here</a>.
(For some reason, the first several slides in either presentation aren’t
displaying properly within my browser, so you may need to download
the file(s) to view all of the slides.)
I’m expecting the videos of the presentations to be posted on
<a href="https://youtube.com">youtube</a>,
so we’ll watch for them.  (You can find a video of last year’s
presentation on the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>
<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uVSRTgy-Ui0">here</a>,
together with the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/doc/orconf.pdf">slides for it here</a>–although those slides are now out of date.)</p>

<p>For those who may be interested in trying
out <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>, I’m probably going to take
some time out from these general FPGA based posts to present several
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> examples and basic tutorials.
The first such tutorial will likely be a rewrite of our original
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">debugging bus</a> project, but this time
using <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.  From there, we can
demo the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer">button debouncing project</a>
again, showing how easy it is to reconfigure the original project in order
to add <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/debouncer/blob/master/rtl/debouncer.v">a button
debouncer</a>
and a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">scope</a> into the project using
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.  If all goes well, we’ll
then use <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> to build any further
demonstrations from there.</p>

<p>For those who have never been to <a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a>, please allow
me to tell you a bit about the conference.  First, the conference tends to be
very informal.  (I may have been the only one there wearing a suit.)
The conference also tends to be small.  You will not be lost
in a sea of thousands of individuals, but may instead get a chance to meet
every individual who attends.  Reconnecting with the friends I had made
<a href="https://orconf.org/2017/">last year</a> was an encouragement for me.  Discovering
the history of what others had done before me was also a treat.</p>

<p>Between now and next-time, though, I’ll probably muse on what direction I
should take to move the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>
forward.  I could …</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Dig into the code and make it truly the smallest 32-bit machine out there.
At 1,350–2,500 LUTs, the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>
isn’t the smallest design out there, despite that being it’s ostensible
purpose.  At 600 LUTs it would be a lot closer.  Such a CPU would also
be a lot faster as well.  Many thanks to Jan for sharing with me how to
get the logic count down that low.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finish integrating the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/zipmmu.v">Memory Management
Unit</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/dcache.v">data
cache</a>.
This would bring the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> that much closer to running
<a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux</a>, even though
it will probably slow down the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>’s
memory interactions somewhat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Formally</em> verify that the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>
code faithfully executes its instruction set.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue to work on building peripherals that can be used with the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>. I’m still working on building
up an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI</a> capability, although
building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor">brushless DC
motor</a> controller
might be fun to do as well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here on <a href="https://zipcpu.com/">this blog</a> we’re probably going to continue
pressing towards building some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter">digital
filter</a>s and testing them.  This
includes building a
<a href="/dsp/2017/10/02/cordic-tb.html">proper test bench</a>.
for the <a href="/dsp/2017/08/30/cordic.html">CORDIC cores we’ve
built</a>.
I’ve also been asked by one individual to release a test bench showing the
improvements possible via the
<a href="/dsp/2017/09/04/pwm-reinvention.html">PWM scheme</a> presented
the other day.  If anyone else is interested, I may move forward on that as
well.</p>

<p>For me, in the end,
<a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a>
was a success because of all that I learned there.  For that I thank not
only those who helped to organize the conference, but also all of those who
attended and took the time with me to teach me about open source hardware
from their individual perspectives.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
