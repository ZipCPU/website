    <p>After a year of waiting, it’s time for <a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a>.
If you are not familiar with <a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a>,
then allow me to encourage you to examine <a href="https://orconf.org">their web-page</a>,
and look over the <a href="https://orconf.org/#presentations">abstracts of the
presentations</a> that will be given this year.
Looks like it will be quite the lineup.</p>

<p>This year, I’ll be giving two presentations.</p>

<p>My first presentation will be a quick
update on the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.
Since <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/doc/orconf.pdf">last year</a>,
the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> has been updated so as to
support …</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>8-bit byte-level access across the 32-bit bus.</p>

    <p>Prior to this redesign, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
was one of a few rare 32-bit byte machines.</p>

    <p>Now, the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> fully supports
8-bit bytes instead of the 32-bit bytes it supported before.</p>

    <p>This required a bit of instruction set redesign.  Opcodes were re-ordered.
Rotate left <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ROL</code> and population count <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POPC</code> instructions have been removed.
The load and store instructions have been renamed load word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LW</code> and store
word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SW</code> instructions.  Four basic instructions have been added as well:
load half-word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LH</code>, store halfword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SH</code>, load byte <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LB</code> and store byte <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SB</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A compressed instruction set (CIS).</p>

    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> has always had a CIS,
although it was previously mis-named as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_long_instruction_word">Very Long Instruction Word
(VLIW)</a>
set of instructions–which it never really was.  The CIS instruction set
allows you to integrate pairs of 16-bit instructions together with the
32-bit instructions.  It provides some increased code density as a result.</p>

    <p>Over the last year, I’ve had the opportunity to test the CIS instructions on
the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> and work out the bugs
within them.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/tree/master/sw">current
toolchain</a> builds with CIS
instructions enabled by default.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nearly the same number of LUTs</p>

    <p>Despite all of these changes, the number of LUTs used by the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> remains roughly the same.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As a result of these changes, the <a href="https://sourceware.org/newlib">newlib</a>
C-library now runs on the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>–something it didn’t do before.
That means you can now play <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/tttt">4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe</a>
on the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>!</p>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/blob/master/doc/orconf17.pdf">second
presentation</a>
will be an overview of <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.
Here’s the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>
into a new environment can be a daunting task.  Components
need to be selected, resources allocated, addresses given, interrupts
assigned, and peripherals configured–not only in the HDL code, but also for
all of the software support.  The problem with this approach to designing
hardware is that it works very well for one-off solutions, but not as well
for quickly creating generic solutions to new problems.  This is where
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> comes in.</p>

  <p>Given a <a href="https://github.com/zipCPU/autofpga/tree/master/auto-data">set of
components</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
builds the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/tree/master/demo-out/">boiler plate
files</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/blob/master/demo-out/toplevel.v">top
level</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/blob/master/demo-out/main.v">main</a>
design files, the <a href="/doc/wbspec_b4.pdf">Wishbone</a>
interconnect, and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/blob/master/demo-out/board.h">software header
file</a>s
necessary for software support within that design.  As a result, I can
reconfigure a project with new hardware in a matter of minutes, rather
than the days it took before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I get back, I’ll post about my experiences and thoughts.  When the
presentation video’s are posted on youtube, I intend to post those links
here as well.</p>
