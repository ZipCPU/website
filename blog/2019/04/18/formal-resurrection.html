    <p>In honor of <a href="/blog/2018/04/01/resurrection-day.html">Resurrection
Day</a> this year,
let’s take a moment to apply formal methods in reverse, as though we were
detectives, in order to back out the timeline of the week when Christ
was crucified.</p>

<p>Specifically, I’d like to investigate the timing of a couple of events
that took place leading up to Resurrection day.  These events include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The last supper,</li>
  <li>The night of prayer in Gethsemane,</li>
  <li>The crucifixion,</li>
  <li>The time He spent in the tomb, and</li>
  <li>The visit to the tomb early on Sunday morning</li>
</ul>

<p>We can express these events as inputs to a design, so we’ll constrain them
using assumptions:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">module</span>	<span class="n">resurrection</span><span class="p">(</span>
	<span class="kt">input</span>	<span class="kt">wire</span>		<span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">,</span>

	<span class="kt">input</span>	<span class="kt">wire</span>		<span class="n">i_request_guards</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="kt">input</span>	<span class="kt">wire</span>		<span class="n">i_resurrection</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="kt">input</span>	<span class="kt">wire</span>		<span class="n">i_tomb_visit</span><span class="p">,</span>

	<span class="kt">input</span>	<span class="kt">wire</span>		<span class="n">i_sabbath</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="kt">output</span>	<span class="kt">reg</span>		<span class="n">o_valid</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You may notice that I’ve added a couple other items into the timeline as well,
such as when the chief priests requested guards for the temple and when the
women prepared the spices they then later brought to the tomb.  We’ll discuss
these more as we go along.  I’ve also added in inputs for the preparation
days and the Sabbath(s), because those will become important in this discussion
as well.</p>

<p>Our goal will be to let the formal tool, in this case
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SymbiYosys</a> as a front-end for
the <a href="http://yices.csl.sri.com">yices</a> engine, solve for the timing of these
events, subject to the formal constraints we’ll discuss below.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-framework-for-our-events">Creating a framework for our events</h2>

<p>Part of the goal here is to determine when events took place.  This means
that we need a structure we can use to describe the events of interest.</p>

<p>We’ll also use synchronous logic, and so that means that we’ll start with the
clock, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_clk</code>.  Let’s assume that it has a period of twice
per day, with the rising edge at both dawn and dusk.  While I understand
that this will cause the duty cycle to vary somewhat, I’m not really
expecting any struggles to meet timing if we run the clock this slowly.</p>

<p>This clock speed will also allow us to reason about whether an event happened
during the day or during the night.  To get there, we’ll use a counter to
describe time for us–to include which day of the week, Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, etc., an event is taking place on.  We can do all of this with
a 14-state counter, such as the counter below that goes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> on Sunday
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">13</code> on Saturday and back again.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">time_of_week</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">time_of_week</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">time_of_week</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span>
		<span class="n">time_of_week</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">time_of_week</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Further, in Jewish fashion dating back to the beginning,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gen/1/5">Gen 1:5</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>we’ll count days that begin and end at sundown.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">nighttime</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">time_of_week</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">daytime</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">nighttime</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ll also assign days to counter values, so we can later make sense of the
trace <a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SymbiYosys</a>
will generate for us.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">sunday</span>    <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">time_of_week</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>Fig. 1 below should give you an idea of what this might look like.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1.  Weekdays and daytimes</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/resurrection/resurrection-weekdays.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Now we can now couple this counter with inferences from the Bible.  For
example, we know that the Sabbath <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ex/20/9">takes place on
Saturday</a>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">saturday</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="n">i_sabbath</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We also know that the Sabbath begins or ends at nighttime.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">daytime</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nb">changed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_sabbath</span><span class="p">));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s see where this all leads us.</p>

<h2 id="it-all-starts-with-the-last-supper">It all starts with the last supper</h2>

<p>While I suppose we might start with the triumphal entry, I’d rather start our
reasoning off with the Last Supper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was
come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having
loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.  And
supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas
Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him;
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/13/1">John 13:1-2</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those not familiar with the Last Supper, this was the night when,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them,
saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in
my blood, which is shed for you.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/22/19">Luke 22:19-20</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that’s not my point today.  Today, I just want to work through the order
of events.</p>

<p>The Last Supper is then followed by an evening in the Garden of Gethsemane.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/18/1">John 18:1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this, we know that the last supper occurred in the day time,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">daytime</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_last_supper</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and that it was followed by the night in Gethsemane.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="n">i_last_supper</span> <span class="o">|=&gt;</span>  <span class="n">i_gethsemane</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This isn’t quite enough of a constraint to force the night in Gethsemane to
immediately (and only ever) follow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_last_supper</code>.  We also need to tell the
formal tool that the night in Gethsemane <em>only</em> occurs following the
last supper, and never at any other time.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_last_supper</span> <span class="o">|=&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_gethsemane</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="the-night-in-the-garden">The night in the Garden</h2>

<p>After the Last Supper, Jesus went to pray in the Garden of Gethsemane.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/26/36">Matt 26:36</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was here, in the garden, that Luke, the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/col/4/14">beloved
physician</a>, records that
his prayers were so agonizing that He sweat blood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were
great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/22/44">Luke 22:44</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know this took place at night because, among other things, his disciples
were struggling to stay awake.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying
the same words.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/26/43-44">Matt 26:43-44</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence, we can assume that the night in Gethsemane, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_gethsemane</code>, only
took place during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nighttime</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">nighttime</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_gethsemane</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You may perhaps be wondering why I have chosen this backwards notation.
Could I not have instead said that, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_gethsemane |-&gt; nighttime</code>?
Probably.  However, I’m trying to capture the idea that the signal
I am assuming should be on the right hand of the implication.  Therefore, the
backwards notation is primarily to make plain which value I’m intending to
constrain with the assumption.</p>

<p>Returning to the timeline, it was in Gethsemane that Jesus was betrayed and
arrested.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,
and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</p>

  <p>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a
great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders
of the people.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/26/45-47">Matt 26:45-47</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the next day, after a sham trial, the chief priests and elders led
Jesus to Pilate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people
took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: And when they had bound
him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the
governor.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/27/1-2">Matt 27:1-2</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I’m sure they would’ve loved to murder Him themselves, the Romans had
a law prohibiting the Jews from executing those they chose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your
law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any
man to death:
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/18/31">John 18:31</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, we might write that the day of the Crucifixion follows the
arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">i_gethsemane</span> <span class="o">|=&gt;</span> <span class="n">i_crucifixion</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_gethsemane</span> <span class="o">|=&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_crucifixion</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="the-day-of-the-crucifixion">The Day of the Crucifixion</h2>

<p>We know Jesus was crucified in the day time, for it is written that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth
hour.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/27/45">Matt 27:45</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the custom of the time, the time of day was measured from dawn,
rather than as we do today from midnight.  Therefore, this took place between
high noon and 3pm in the afternoon.</p>

<p>We can capture this with the assumption that,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">daytime</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_crucifixion</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, we know from the record that the next day was the Sabbath, primarily
because those who buried Him had to press to get Him into the tomb before the
Sabbath, lest His body remain on the cross all the next day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is,
the day before the sabbath, Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor,
which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto
Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.  And Pilate marvelled if he were
already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether
he had been any while dead.  And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave
the body to Joseph.</p>

  <p>And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen,
and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a
stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mar/15/42-46">Mark 15:42-46</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this we might conclude not only that the crucifixion didn’t take place
on a Sabbath,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">i_sabbath</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_crucifixion</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>but also that the day of the crucifixion was immediately followed by a Sabbath.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">i_crucifixion</span> <span class="o">|=&gt;</span> <span class="n">i_sabbath</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 2.  Preparation day</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/resurrection/resurrection-preparation.svg" alt="" width="300" /></td></tr></table>

<p>We also know from this description that, in the language of the time, the
day prior to the Sabbath was called the “preparation day”.  Let’s assume
that this preparation day describes the <em>daylight</em> portion of the day as well.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span> <span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">daytime</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_preparation_day</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We also know that the day following the preparation day is a Sabbath.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span> <span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">i_preparation_day</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="p">##</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="n">i_sabbath</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Likewise, no Sabbath shall take place unless it is preceded by a preparation
day.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span> <span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">daytime</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_preparation_day</span>
			<span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="p">##</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_sabbath</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note the extra requirement here that this criteria only applies to the daytime.
Since the preparation day cannot take place at nighttime, based upon our
assumption above, without this extra condition there could be no Sabbaths.</p>

<p>At one time I was going to declare the preparation day to be the day of the
Crucifixion.  I think I’ll just assert this instead, and so let the solver
do the proof for me.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">i_crucifixion</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="n">i_preparation_day</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, since there are things that happen after the crucifixion, let’s keep
track of those in two ways.  First, once the crucifixion has passed, then
Jesus had been crucified.  We can write this as,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">crucified</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_crucifixion</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">crucified</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We also know that He was only crucified once.  While this might seem
obvious to you and I, the formal tool does require this information.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">crucified</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_crucifixion</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="three-days-and-three-nights">Three Days and Three Nights</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most controversial part of all of this is including the prophecy
that Jesus was going to spend three days and three nights in the tomb.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall
the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/12/40">Matt 12:40</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let’s count these out.  First, He enters the tomb following the crucifixion,
and then leaves it after three days and three nights.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">in_the_tomb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>The check is off by one from six, for the simple reason that we are reasoning
about the <em>next</em> clock cycle, but more on that in a bit.</p>

<p>For now, let’s count the days,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">buried_days</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>and the nights when He is in the tomb.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">buried_nights</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>We’ll know He was in the tomb for three days and three nights when these
two counters equal three.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">three_days</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">buried_days</span>   <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">three_nights</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">buried_nights</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now we can put our test together: If He’s been crucified, yet is no longer
in the tomb, then He must’ve been in the tomb for three days and three nights:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assert</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

		<span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="n">three_days</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">three_nights</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This trace might therefore look like Fig. 3 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3. Jesus was in the tomb for three days and three nights</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/resurrection/resurrection-3days.svg" alt="" width="540" /></td></tr></table>

<p>So, why did we transition on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6</code> above?  Because we counted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>
as our first time-step.  Hence, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code> are six steps.  If you examine the
trace in Fig. 3 at the right, you can see that,
yes, we did count three days and three nights as desired, until He was out
of the tomb.</p>

<p>Yes, I’ve heard the arguments for fewer days.  The problem is that if He was
crucified on a Friday (the commonly proposed theory), then he would have been
in the ground for one day and two nights, not three days and three nights.  The
answer I’ve been given, that the ancient Greeks didn’t know how to count
properly just doesn’t hold water for me.  The historical record tells us
that people were <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gen/7/24">counting days as early as the
flood</a>, and that by the time of
Christ they knew how to <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/25/27">calculate
interest</a>.
So, I don’t buy the argument that the ancient Greeks didn’t know how to count.</p>

<p>Three days and three nights, therefore, must mean three days and three nights.</p>

<h2 id="the-spices-and-the-soldiers">The Spices and the Soldiers</h2>

<p>After Jesus was buried, certain women which came from Galilee went and prepared
spices, and then rested.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
And the women also, which came with him from Galilee,
followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.  And
they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath
day according to the commandment.  (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/23/54-56">Luke 23:54-56</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tells us that these women were devout in their faith, and so they wouldn’t
have prepared any spices on the sabbath.  We can also draw from this that
Jesus was in the tomb when they prepared the spices.  We also know that,
without artificial light, the spices would’ve been very difficult to prepare
anything, so they didn’t do this at night.  That leaves us with the following
assumption:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span>	<span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">in_the_tomb</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="n">i_sabbath</span>

<p>Finally, in order to check whether, on the Resurrection day, these spices had
been prepared or not, we’ll register a value to keep track that they had been
prepared.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">spices_prepared</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_prepare_spices</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">spices_prepared</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 4. Preparing the spices</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/resurrection/resurrection-spices.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Now, while Jesus was in the tomb, the chief priests and Pharisees came to ask
for a guard to be posted,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief
priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</p>

  <p>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,
 After three days I will rise again.
Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest
 his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people,
 He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye
 can.
So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting
 a watch.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/27/62-66">Matt 27:62-66</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note here that, again, the three day prophecy is confirmed–even by those
who didn’t believe Him.  But I digress.</p>

<p>While the following logic captures this idea of the day following the day
of preparation, it is perhaps more complicated than it needs to be.  The
reason for the extra complication is that the “preparation day” was the
day of the crucifixion, and the day after is not one time step later, but
rather two.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">day_after_preparation_day</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 5. Guarding the Tomb</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/resurrection/resurrection-guarded.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Following this request, we know the tomb was guarded, as shown in Fig. 5 on the
right.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">tomb_guarded</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>Of course, this places the request on the Sabbath day.  In many ways,
I find it strange that the chief priests would go to Pilate on the Sabbath
day, but perhaps it’s no stranger than the rest of their actions that week.
For example, trying Jesus at night was already a violation of Jewish law.
If the chief priests were willing to violate one law in such a gross manner,
why should they be expected to hold to the rest of Jewish laws and customs?</p>

<h2 id="constraining-the-resurrection">Constraining the Resurrection</h2>

<p>We’d also like to determine when Jesus was resurrected.  Since this is
one of those things we want to determine, we want to make absolute certain
that it is only minimally constrained.  One obvious constraint would be
that He can’t be resurrected until He’s been crucified.  I’m going to
add one more, though: He can’t be resurrected unless He’s no longer in
the tomb.  Therefore,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span> <span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">in_the_tomb</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">crucified</span>
		<span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_resurrection</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I’ll go one step more, though, and add yet another constraint.
This one will pin down the exact time of the resurrection–to within the
structure of our timeline.  Specifically, let’s define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_resurrection</code>
as the first clock period when He’s no longer in the tomb.  Hence,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="k">assume</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_resurrection</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="p">$</span><span class="nb">fell</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">in_the_tomb</span><span class="p">));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This should be a sufficient constraint for the solver to match what
we might expect.</p>

<h2 id="resurrection-day">Resurrection Day</h2>

<p>This leaves us with one final set of constraints–the first day of the week
when the women come to the tomb to find Him gone.  This is well attested
by every one of the Gospels.</p>

<p>Matthew:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/28/1">Matt 28:1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mar/16/1-2">Mark 16:1-2</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luke:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came
unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and
certain others with them.
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/24/1-2">Luke 24:1-2</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark,
unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/20/1">John 20:1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence, the morning visit to the tomb must have taken place on Sunday.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">assume</span> <span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">sunday</span> <span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">i_tomb_visit</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Why was the <em>first</em> day a Sunday, as opposed to any other day?  Because, it is
recorded in Exodus that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:
But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not
do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy
maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in
them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath
day, and hallowed it.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ex/20/9-11">Ex 20:9-11</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ever since the commandment, and perhaps even before as well, the seventh
day of the week has been maintained as the Jewish Sabbath.
We know today that this seventh day is Saturday, therefore the “first day
of the week” must be a Sunday.</p>

<p>This isn’t all of it either.  We also know that when the women visited the tomb,
they found it empty.</p>

<p>Matthew:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</p>

  <p>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/28/2-7">Matt 28:2-7</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</p>

  <p>And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</p>

  <p>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mar/16/3-6">Mark 16:3-6</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luke:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>

  <p>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p>

  <p>And they remembered his words,
And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/24/2-9">Luke 24:2-9</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came
 first to the sepulchre.
And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went
 he not in.</p>

  <p>Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</p>

  <p>Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre,
and he saw, and believed.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/20/4-8">John 20:4-8</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, what do we know from the accounts of these witnesses?  We know
that the tomb was empty, that the women had prepared spices, that they came
to the tomb after dawn on a Sunday, and that the guards were still there.</p>

<h2 id="the-resurrection-putting-it-all-together">The Resurrection: Putting it all together</h2>

<p>So what do you get when you put all of this together?</p>

<p>Well first, if you don’t get your properties right, you’ll get a contradiction.
Worse, since most of our properties are assumptions, the contradiction will
end without a trace, you’ll simply see,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">SBY 16:09:47 [resurrection_prf] engine_0.basecase: ##   0:00:00  Warmup failed!
SBY 16:09:47 [resurrection_prf] engine_0.basecase: ##   0:00:00  Status: FAILED</code></pre></figure>

<p>That doesn’t help.</p>

<p>However, if you bisect your assumptions, you’ll often find the problem.
The properties discussed above have been checked, so there are no (more)
contradictions within them.  Indeed, you can <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/website/blob/master/examples/resurrection.sv">check them out here if you would
like</a>.
I’ve even posted the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/website/blob/master/examples/resurrection.sby">SymbiYosys script for
reference</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, since we’re primarily running a cover proof, if the cover fails,
you might wish to back up and cover all of the steps leading up to the final
one.  When you find the point that fails, you can again bisect the assumptions
to find the one that is contradictory.  (Yes, I needed to do this too, although
I’ve since cleaned up these extraneous cover statements.)</p>

<p>As an example of a contradictory property, if you assume that the Crucifixion
took place on a Friday, you would find no solution to these properties.</p>

<p>When you put it all together, you’ll get something like Fig. 6 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 6.  A formally generated timeline leading up to the Resurrection</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/resurrection/resurrection-week.svg"><img src="/img/resurrection/resurrection-week.svg" alt="" width="780" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>You’ll notice some very fascinating things about this figure that go contrary
to popular belief.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Jesus wasn’t crucified on a Friday.  A Friday crucifixion would’ve violated
several properties of the Biblical account.  First, no matter how you
count it, a Friday crucifixion would not have left him in the ground for
three days and three nights.  Second, had He been crucified on a Friday,
there would’ve been no time for the women to purchase and prepare their
spices–something that cannot be done on the Sabbath day.  Third, even the
chief priests expected something to happen on the <em>third</em> day.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, you might choose to find that this conclusion says a lot
about me.  For example, you might notice that I <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/15/3">don’t much care what any
church says</a> or teaches about
“Good Friday”–I care only about what the Bible teaches.  As a result, I
don’t suffer from any crisis of faith when I come across information
that might contradict what the Bible teaches: I just choose to believe
what the Bible says.</p>

    <p>Incidentally, this is also the meaning of the word “epanorthosis” used in
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2ti/3/16">2Tim 3:16</a>,
and translated as “correction”, when Paul uses it to describe the nature
of God’s words:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2ti/3/16">2Tim 3:16</a>)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Indeed, the <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/epanorthosis.html">Greek Lexicon defines epanorthosis</a> as: 1. Restoration
to an upright or right state, 2. Correction, improvement of life
or character.</p>

    <p>In this case, we can <em>correct</em> our understanding of the Resurrection by
simply paying attention to the Bible itself–as
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2ti/3/16">2Tim 3:16</a>
suggests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jesus wasn’t in the tomb when the angel rolled the stone away.  Therefore
the actual resurrection must have occurred beforehand.</p>

    <p>This actually corresponds to the Gospel accounts: when the angel rolled
the stone away, the women were invited to look into the tomb to verify
that it was indeed and already empty.</p>

    <p>But then how did He get out?  Good question.  Let me answer that by
asking how He got into the upper room later that day:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for
fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto
them, Peace be unto you.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/20/19">John 20:19</a>)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Personally, I judge walking through walls to be easier than rising from
the dead in the first place, so this theory of being able to walk through
the tomb walls doesn’t really bother me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were two Sabbath days on crucifixion week.</p>

    <p>Wait, what?  Saturday is the Sabbath!  How could there be two Sabbath days?!</p>

    <p>As it turns out, Sabbath’s take place on more than just Saturdays.  Consider
this passage of Leviticus describing the Passover feast:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD’s passover.
And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/lev/23/5-8">Lev 23:5-8</a>)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>While I’m no expert in ancient Jewish customs, I will note that during this
week of the Passover, there are two specific days where no work is to be
done.  These would be rest days, also known as Sabbaths.  I would also note
that no enduring calendar is based upon weeks, nor could it be, since as
you and I both know there are 365 days in a year, which is just a touch
longer than 52 weeks per year.  Hence, in order to keep the year matching
the seasons, the 14th day of the first month would by necessity need to
wander through which day of the week it landed upon–forcing a Sabbath
rest on days other than Saturday alone.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>What conclusion should be drawn from this discussion of the Resurrection?
First, that the Resurrection happened.  <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/15/5-8">Over 500 people saw and witnessed
the resurrected Christ</a>.
Indeed, <a href="/blog/2018/04/01/resurrection-day.html">Christianity would make no sense if there was no
Resurrection</a>.</p>

<p>The second relevant point of the Resurrection follows Jesus’ explanation of
its importance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen,
  and fared sumptuously every day:
And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate,
  full of sores,
And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table:
  moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</p>

  <p>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels
  into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</p>

  <p>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar
  off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus,
  that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I
  am tormented in this flame.</p>

  <p>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy
  good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted,
  and thou art tormented.
And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that
  they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to
  us, that would come from thence.</p>

  <p>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to
  my father’s house:
For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come
  into this place of torment.</p>

  <p>Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</p>

  <p>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead,
  they will repent.</p>

  <p>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will
they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/16/19-31">Luke 16:19-31</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rich man <em>begged</em> for someone to come back from the dead to warn of
the torment waiting for those who have not believed.  God was kind enough to
grant the rich man’s wish.  As a result, we can now say that someone <em>has</em>
come back from the dead.</p>

<p>Tell me, was Abraham right?  Or will you hear hear the words of Jesus today?</p>

<p>My third point is more personal: I know the Resurrection is true, because of
the change that has taken place in my own life once I chose to trust the
only Christ.  I was once a sinner, a liar, thief, and worse.  Once I chose
to trust the Lord, He transformed my life and I am now no longer the wicked
man I once was.</p>

<p>Hallelujah!  Thank you, Lord Jesus, for changing my life.</p>

<p>This change could be yours as well, if you chose to trust Him as I have done.
Will you hear his words today?</p>
