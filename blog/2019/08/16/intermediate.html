    <p>I’ve been known for wandering through <a href="/digilent/2017/05/18/most-common-digilent-support-requests.html">an FPGA forum or two, and I’ve see some
common and reoccurring
themes</a>.
One of them is, “My design isn’t working and I don’t know why
not.”  It’s the reason I dedicated this blog to keeping individuals out of
“<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>” as I called it.</p>

<p>Indeed, I saw such a post again just this morning.  Someone had a MicroBlaze
design that wasn’t starting.  It worked on an older board, but not the newer
revision of the board.  What might be wrong?</p>

<p>If all you know is that, “My design doesn’t start,” you don’t have much to
debug from.</p>

<p>This was one of the reasons why one of my first blog topics was how to build
a <a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">debugging bus</a>
followed by the <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">wishbone
scope</a>.
Why?  Because this is how I debug problems like that.  Using the two of those,
I can typically trace anything going wrong down to a trace between two
interfaces.  At that point, you can then visually “see” what’s going on.</p>

<p>Sadly, if all you have are the vendor tools, it’s very hard to “see” what’s
going on.  Worse, I find myself quick to blame someone else’s code when I
don’t see a problem in my own–even if I can’t figure out what the problem is.</p>

<p>It was for this reason that I <a href="/fpga-hell.html">dedicated the blog</a> to keeping individuals out of
“<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>”.
One of the problems associated with blogging, however, is that my articles
1) tend not to be arranged in any particular order, and 2) tend not to get
updated over time.</p>

<p>This was my first reason for writing a <a href="/tutorial">beginner’s
tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The second reason for writing a <a href="/tutorial/">beginner’s
tutorial</a> was in response to problems
I’ve seen with the more traditional instruction.  For example, I’ve seen
students confuse “testbench” constructs with “synthesizable” constructs and
then wonder why their design doesn’t work.  I’ve seen students create bench
tests that provide less test coverage of their code than “modern” swimwear.</p>

<p>Indeed, I <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">once had the same problem in my own
designs</a>: My own test
coverage left me
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/12/28/ugliest-bug.html">chasing bugs in my designs over late nights, and GB traces containing the
bug</a>
… somewhere … within them.  It was specifically for this reason that I
<a href="/blog/2018/01/22/formal-progress.html">fell in love with formal
verification</a> so
quickly–it finds the bugs within your design that my own testbenches were
always missing.</p>

<p>When no one listened to me hollering about the way I felt things “should” be
done, I decided to try writing a <a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>
myself to help teach what’s missing.</p>

<p>So far, that
<a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>
has been well received.  Sure, I’ve had some welcome but less than flattering
comments.  Perhaps the biggest one regards
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
and the C++ nature of the <a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>.
Why should C++ be required when your goal is to learn Verilog and FPGA design.
I get it.  A similar comment regards “make” files we used.  However, you can’t
do things like <a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">this VGA
simulator</a> without some basic
software background, and a lot of folks are coming into the FPGA community
with that background–much like me.  For them, at least, it makes sense.</p>

<p>That said, there’s a strong need in the community for teaching materials that
will teach “From blinky to AXI,” and while <a href="/tutorial">my own
tutorial</a> gets past blinky, it doesn’t make it
anywhere near <a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>.</p>

<p>So let me present some of my thoughts today regarding how this might be fixed.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-the-intermediate-tutorial">The problem with the intermediate tutorial</h2>

<p>There’s a couple of reasons why I have yet to start on an intermediate FPGA
tutorial.  One is that I sell my services and … things have been quite busy
as of late.  (Sorry, but this blog is a <em>hobby</em> of mine rather than something
that puts food on the table for my family.)  The second reason is that the
next step really requires a lot of design-ware that few students would like
to build.</p>

<p>Allow me to explain.</p>

<p>Many of the FPGA designs I’ve worked with involve some kind of bus master
together with several bus slaves.  The common task, then, for the FPGA designer
is to build a new bus slave.  A classic example of this might be to create a
new piece of hardware to add to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>’s
capabilities, such as is shown in Fig. 1 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1. A typical CPU based design</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/im-tutorial/tut-im-cpu.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The task of the student is then to build this new slave.  Perhaps he has several
such slaves he’d like to build.</p>

<p>Were I to build this the way my mathematical background requires, I’d want
to teach everything from the bus master, to the S(D)RAM memory controller,
to the <a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">bus interconnect</a> before the student gets to their first bus slave.
You know, learn multiplication before square roots.  In this case, that’d be …</p>

<p><em>BORING!</em></p>

<p>I mean, seriously, would you want to know how to build a
<a href="https://www.teachengineering.org/lessons/view/cub_dams_lesson03">lock and dam</a>
just to go canoing on the river?</p>

<p>Here’s another example design that’s common among FPGAs: you want to process
data, say an image perhaps.  That means you want to read the image from memory
(there’s not enough room in block RAM to store most images), process it however,
and then store it back into memory again.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2. A basic processing pipeline</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/im-tutorial/tut-im-procbare.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>While this might be a typical signal or image processing application, there’s
a missing piece to it: the design usually begins and ends with Matlab or, in
my case, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, you build your design in
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a> and prove that your algorithm
  works</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along the way, you discover how to measure the performance of your
  algorithm, and you learn how to communicate (i.e. plot) that performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now you want to put it on an FPGA.  So, you build your data processing
  algorithm to put it on the FPGA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s now the big moment: As you are synthesizing your brand-new algorithm
in order to place it into an FPGA design, you suddenly realize that you
have no way of getting your data set into or out of memory.  Worse, even
if you do realize that, you have no easy way to get it in or out of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">Octave</a> from your design, even if you
were to get it into memory.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can see the problem illustrated below in Fig. 3,</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3. A traditional data streaming problem</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/im-tutorial/tut-im-procpipe.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Of course, what I haven’t mentioned is that the end goal of this sort of stream
processing task is typically not to process the data within memory, but rather
to receive the data on some signal or video feed, process it, and then to
forward the output back to a similar feed.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4. From input to output</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/im-tutorial/tut-im-procpipeio.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Where’s the tutorial to teach that?</p>

<p>There isn’t one (that I know of).  (I don’t really know of that many.)</p>

<p>Hence, the reality is that a lot of individuals end up using the vendor tools
and vendor design components and have no idea what’s going wrong when they
don’t work.</p>

<p>As an example, a recent Xilinx user wrote that he’d written a lot of data into
his Xilinx stream processor and no data ever came out.  Why not?  Eventually,
after some back and forth, he realized he’d never marked the <em>end</em> of the
data packet.  Now, without using your own code, or at least something that’s
open source, how would you ever find a bug like that?</p>

<p>My point in all of this is simply that, when your goal is data processing,
you don’t really want to build all of that miracle glueware shown in Fig. 3
above–just like you didn’t want to build the interconnect and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>
shown in the example before that, in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand that most FPGA vendors provide cores and logic that can
handle all of this middle ware.  Personally, I have a couple of problems
with using these cores.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, and perhaps most important, if you ever need to switch hardware
  vendors, you’ll have to tear apart your design and rebuild it for the new
  cores using their new interfaces.</p>

    <p>This includes switching design flows, even for the same hardware.  For
example, if there were an open source tool chain, would you be able to get
by without the vendor supplied cores?  How about if you wanted to use
an open source simulator, like
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>?
Know of any good <a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">open source
interconnects</a>?  Or tools
to connect your components to said open source interconnects?</p>

    <p>Or have you not noticed that I have
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> based designs for
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">iCE40</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipversa">ECP5</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">Xilinx</a>, <em>and</em>
<a href="/zipcpu/2019/03/12/arrowzip.html">Intel</a>?  Yes, it
is doable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, the purpose of the intermediate tutorial we are discussing would be
for learning.  It’s one thing to use a vendor’s core when you have a product
that’s due on a tight schedule.  Sure, I get it, go for it.  I’m not knocking
that at all.  On the other hand, if you want to learn design, then doesn’t
it make sense to spend your time learning how to build your own versions
of the basic building blocks before you turn around and use those from a
vendor?</p>

    <p>Worse, wouldn’t it be a shame if you learned how to design using vendor
based building blocks but then … had to switch tools and discovered that
you no longer knew anything because you could no longer use the cores and
tools you were familiar with?  For example, have you ever tried simulating
Xilinx’s AXI interconnect using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en8JMz7v3LU">the fastest
simulator</a>
out there?  (Hint: it’s not Vivado.)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>My point here is simply this: there’s a need for instruction material that
goes past basic serial port I/O in a vendor independent fashion.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial-goals">Tutorial Goals</h2>

<p>As always, one of the goals of the tutorial is to have the widest applicability
possible.  That means it needs to share FPGA design concepts and strategies
in a vendor independent fashion.  That means I can’t really use vendor code in
my tutorial.  That includes all the vendor glueware, bus interconnects, etc.</p>

<p>My apologies to all of you big-named vendors out there.  On the other hand,
after trying to answer questions from clueless forum posters, wouldn’t you
rather have customer’s who knew how to debug their own designs?</p>

<p>So, here was my thought: Using entirely open source tools, so that the design
components could be verified with
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a> and then simulated
using <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>,
create a set of lessons similar to those shown
in Fig. 5 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 5. Proposed intermediate tutorial structure</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/im-tutorial/tut-intermediate.svg" alt="" width="720" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The lessons would use
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
to connect all of the parts and pieces together.  In every lesson, the goal
would be to be able to formally verify any new components, then to run the
design in a
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
based simulation, and then in actual hardware.</p>

<p>The lesson sequence would start out by discussing some of your basic slave
design components.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first lesson would start out by creating a <a href="/zipcpu/2019/02/09/cpu-blinky.html">very simple “blinky”
design</a>,
but this time using the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
generated <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone
bus</a>.  Commands sent
from the host over the <a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">debugging
bus</a> would be used
to turn LEDs on and off.</p>

    <p>For those who don’t recall the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/README.md">debugging bus
articles</a>, a
“<a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">debugging bus</a>” is
my term for a bus, internal to an FPGA, that can be accessed and commanded
from host (PC) software.  Even better, I like to run my <a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">debugging
bus</a> software <a href="/blog/2017/06/17/why-network-debugging.html">over
a network</a>,
allowing me to interact with either my design or its simulation from
anywhere on my local network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second lesson would involve simply <a href="/dsp/2017/07/11/simplest-sinewave-generator.html">creating an audio
tone</a>.
This would be very similar to the first lesson, but might involve a couple
of bus addresses, to allow the developer to control amplitude and frequency
from their external computer as one example.  The tone itself could be
played using a basic <a href="/dsp/2017/09/04/pwm-reinvention.html">PWM controller</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third lesson would be quick, just showing how to connect a <a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">block
RAM</a> to the bus as
well as how to verify RAM based slaves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’d then discuss building a “<a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">bus
scope</a>”.  If you’ve
read my blog much, you’ll know that I use what I call a “<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">wishbone
scope</a>”.
You’d be amazed at the <a href="/blog/2017/09/14/even-i-get-stuck.html">bugs you can find and
diagnose</a> using
something like this.</p>

    <p>This is somewhat different from using vendor tools (chipscope, ILA, etc),
simply because it is bus based.  This will allow you greater control of the
scope, eventually allowing you to control it from your embedded
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>–but
we’re not there yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final slave in this section of the course would be your <a href="/blog/2018/08/16/spiflash.html">basic xSPI
flash memory controller</a>.
This could be done either with SPI or
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">QSPI</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Voila, the first section of an intermediate Verilog tutorial.</p>

<p>The second section of the tutorial would focus on bus masters, rather than bus
slaves.</p>

<ol start="6">
  <li>It would begin with a set of lessons on creating a video output.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(6) The first might discuss <a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">outputting a fixed test
 pattern</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(7) That lesson would be followed with a stream processing lesson where
a “sprite” of some type would be added to the video stream.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(8) The next lesson would be (generic) on <a href="/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html">asynchronous
FIFOs</a>.  Although this
is really a video independent topic, it’s really a necessary background
for the next lesson</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(9) The final video lesson would be on how to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/wbvgaframe.v">stream pixels from a (fixed)
memory location</a>
to the video controller and hence to the VGA screen.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of this would be simulatable using
  <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>.
  Perhaps painfully simulatable, but simulatable none the less.</p>

<ol start="10">
  <li>
    <p>We’ll then move back to a quick bus slave, to learn how to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpmic">control a basic
SPI A/D controller</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once we have a way to ingest samples, the next lesson would discuss how
to record samples from something like an A/D controller to memory, in order
to later be read out using the debugging bus.</p>

    <p>At this point, you should be able to ingest your pipeline processing
algorithm into a design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, before getting into
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>
  design, we’d work our way through a basic
  hardware controller–something that could read “instructions” from a memory,
  and then use them to control a hardware output.  In this case, it should be
  possible to build a basic music box–perhaps something that could play
  “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwa0c8VO71s">Music Box Dancer</a>”?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That would end the basic set of lessons on building bus masters.</p>

<p>The next group of lessons would focus on building a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>.  This would not
be about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Architecture-Quantitative-John-Hennessy/dp/012383872X">ISA design</a> (Sorry, I know my limits), but rather on
implementing some increasingly complex
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>s.</p>

<ol start="13">
  <li>
    <p>The first lesson would discuss just a simple, very basic, microcontroller.
  I haven’t yet decided what ISA I’d use, or if there’s one available that has
  a nice tool suite with it, but you get the idea.</p>

    <p>In this lesson, the student would implement such a simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>
really <a href="//zipcpu/2017/07/14/cpu-debugging-needs.html">needs a debugging
interface</a>,
so we’d add one.  This would allow us to start and stop our
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>,
using the same debugging bus that’s supported us so far, and perhaps even
read registers and state from it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would lead us right into building an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sw/host/zipload.cpp">ELF program
loader</a>.
This could be just something basic that can read a compiled file and load
it into either flash or (block) RAM.  Of course, this would also require
an ELF-based tool chain, and so likely a proper
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">ISA</a>
as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How fast your CPU works is really dependent upon where it’s memory is found,
and linker scripts provide the means of adjusting where your memory is found
within your design.  We’ll discuss how to read, write, and adjust linker
scripts so you have an idea of what’s going on within your design.</p>

    <p>The student should be able to load a CPU (either theirs or mine) so that it
runs from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">Flash</a>, block RAM,
block ROM, or … wherever.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This really then feeds nicely into understanding <a href="/zipcpu/2018/02/12/zbasic-intro.html">how a bootloader
works</a>.
Once you know how to place program instructions (wherever), it’s important
to be able to copy them to where you need them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can then move to a lesson on <a href="/zipcpu/2017/08/23/cpu-pipeline.html">pipelined
CPUs</a>.</p>

    <p>This one I haven’t quite figured out yet, but I’d like to offer something
more complex than the basic state-machine based microcontroller.</p>

    <p>While one option might be to use the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> here,
I want an option that presents some amount of learning to the
student–rather than just following a script.</p>

    <p>Perhaps one option might be adding a special instruction (or two, or four)
to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>.
Another option might be to restructure the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> for some
purpose (such as MMU integration as an example).  We’ll see.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next lesson would focus on how to build a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pfcache.v">cache
controller</a>.
I’d provide the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> to any one
who wished to use it at this point, although I could understand why a
student might rather wish to use their own.  I’m not (yet) set on this
course of action.</p>

    <p>Of course, as with all of these designs, part of the lesson would discuss
how to go about formally verifying the design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we’d discuss the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_the_FAT_file_system">FAT
filesystem</a>,
so that the CPU could access files on an external <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_Card">SD Card</a>.</p>

    <p>Yes, the course will show how this can be done from simulation too.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I think this progression builds nicely, one lesson upon the next, with the
bus components being built growing every more capable.  Further, while
I like this progression of lessons, I’ve noted that with all of my
tutorials students have found it valuable to pick up in the middle
as their interest and needs dictate.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-required">Hardware required</h2>

<p>Unlike the <a href="/tutorial">beginner’s tutorial</a>, once we get
past lesson one, special hardware will be required for the following lessons.
Well, either that or the student might choose (instead) to build the design
in the simulator alone and just go on.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 6. Proposed hardware requirements</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/im-tutorial/generic-hw.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Judging from the hardware we’ve discussed above, to complete all of the lessons
you’d need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">Flash memory</a>
controller (most FPGAs have this)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A VGA port.</p>

    <p>While I’d love to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI</a>,
and while HDMI isn’t really all that much more
difficult, the I/O’s required for HDMI are a touch more challenging
to do in a <em>generic hardware</em> fashion.</p>

    <p>Perhaps this <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-vga-video-graphics-array">dual Pmod VGA
peripheral</a>
would serve our purpose well here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I’d like to avoid any external RAM controllers, the Video lesson
really requires a significant amount of RAM (typically external) in order
to handle streaming from a memory buffer.</p>

    <p>This may require an AXI lesson mid-tutorial.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the best way to handle this in an intermediate course would be to
offer vendors an opportunity to post and share how to interact with their
xDDR SDRAM controllers.  I know I have several SDRAM controllers available
to work from, and even an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/rtl/icozip/sramdev.v">SRAM controller</a>.  I would also expect that the
<a href="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litedram">litedram</a> authors might be
willing to support this project as well.  (Maybe I should ask them?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A simple PWM based audio controller, such as might be used with <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-amp2-audio-amplifier">this
  PMod audio device</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A SPI based A/D.  For this, I was thinking of something similar to
  <a href="http://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-mic3-mems-microphone-with-adjustable-gain">Digilent’s audio
  PMod</a>,
  for which I already have both <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpmic/blob/master/rtl/smpladc.v">(verified) example
code</a> as well
as a decent <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpmic/blob/master/bench/cpp/micnco.cpp">emulator</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, in order to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_Card">SD
Card</a>.  and read and parse a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_the_FAT_file_system">FAT file
filesystem</a>,
you’d need a design with an SD card reader on it.  My current <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SD card
controller</a> is SPI based, so I might
start there.  On the other hand, one of my current projects is to upgrade
that controller to be fully SDIO compliant, so we might do even better.</p>

    <p>For those that do not have an SD card on their board, there does exist
a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-sd-full-sized-sd-card-slot">PMod SD</a>
which might work nicely for this purpose as well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Sadly, not all entry level development boards have all of this hardware,
so whether or not this list is too aggressive or not is an important question.</p>

<h2 id="from-blinky-to-axi--wheres-the-axi">“From Blinky to AXI” … where’s the AXI?</h2>

<p>So I started by saying that a tutorial “From Blinky to AXI” would be a valuable
contribution.  Sadly, the proposed tutorial above doesn’t (yet) discuss
<a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>.
I haven’t quite decided on how to handle that.</p>

<p>I could leave the AXI work for a future “AXI only” tutorial, or I might work
it into this tutorial, or I might just leave it within the
<a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">blog</a>.
Another approach might be to provide the bus with a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/wb2axilite.v">WB to AXI-lite
bridge</a>, and
then to make all of the devices using
<a href="/blog/2019/01/12/demoaxilite.html">AXI-lite</a>.
I’m not quite certain right now.</p>

<p>I am open to ideas, if you’d like to share them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Whew!  While I like this overview of what would be next, I’m not certain any
(potential) students would be interested in something quite this intensive.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts.  I intend to create a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZipCPU/comments/crbyrw/planning_an_intermediate_design_tutorial/">Reddit post</a>
with this article, and hear any comments that might be shared.  Feel free to
join in the discussion.</p>

<p>My own first thought is to note that, while
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
handles multiple slave integration easily, it doesn’t (yet) handle multiple
masters.  The good news is that I’m going to have to fix that already for
a contract I’m working on, so that’s likely to get fixed quickly.</p>

<p>Of course, all of this would only be if the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15">Lord
wills</a>–so we’ll have to see
if any of this ever gets off of the ground in the first place, but your
thoughts would be welcome either way.</p>
