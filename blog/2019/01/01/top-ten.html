  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It’s hard to believe that the first full year of the <a href="">ZipCPU
blog</a> has now come and gone.  Last year I only blogged
for a half a year, starting in May of 2017.  2018, however,
contained a full year of blogging.  The pace of the blog has settled down
a touch, adjusting from moving quickly early on, when I had nothing
better to do and a lot of designs to discuss, to the current pace
as I’ve had to spend my time building new designs to blog about
and even managing to make a touch of money along the way.</p>

<p>Shall we look together across the last year and take stock in what has taken
place?</p>

<h2 id="formal-verification">Formal Verification</h2>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 1.  My design methodology changed, once I experienced formal methods</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/2018-with-formal.png"><img src="/img/2018-with-formal.png" alt="" width="463" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>Towards the end of 2017, I <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">tried my hand at formal verification for the very
first time</a>.
This was at the request of the <a href="https://twitter.com/ico_TC/">SymbiYosys
developers</a>.  Since I was a poor contractor
with no contract at the time, I figured I had nothing to lose.  Much
to my surprise, I quickly discovered I wasn’t the awesome Verilog developer
I imagined myself to be.  Working my way <a href="/blog/2018/01/22/formal-progress.html">from core to core within the
ZipCPU</a>,
I found and fixed bug after bug in components that I had thought were
“working”.</p>

<p>I would’ve never found these bugs without using <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 2.  First formal methods course</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/2018-formal-course.png"><img src="/img/2018-formal-course.png" alt="" width="463" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>As a result, I became a <a href="/formal/2018/07/21/zipcpu-icoboard.html">fast believer in formal
methods</a>.  I
moved quickly, and even created a
<a href="/projects.html">formal verification course</a>
which I was pleased to teach both at multiple corporate
facilities, and to several individuals online.  If this is something that
interests you, I’m currently charging $4,000 plus travel expenses to come to
your facility and teach formal verification to up to six individuals at
a time.  Alternatively, I have been known to teach one or two individuals
at a time via video chat.</p>

<p>Perhaps what surprises me the most about my new-found love for
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
is that I’ve earned a bit of a reputation for being a formal verification
evangelist.  While others may see me this way, this is not how I envision
either myself or my own journey.  My goal has
never been formal verification as an end in itself.  My goal has always been
to earn a wage by producing working designs.  To date, I know of no better
method to do this than to use formal verification along the way.
It’s fast.  It’s easy.  It will lead you right to any bugs.</p>

<p>This is also why the blog has shifted over the last year to placing so much
emphasis on formal verification: it works, it works well, and I also find
it to be a lot of fun.</p>

<h2 id="zipcpu-development">ZipCPU Development</h2>

<table align="center" style="float: left"><caption>Fig 3. The ZipCPU's Structure</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/zipcpu.svg" alt="" width="463" /></td></tr></table>

<p>While the <a href="/zipcpu/2018/01/01/zipcpu-isa.html">ZipCPU’s ISA</a>
has remained constant over the last year, that doesn’t
mean that there’s been no work done on the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.  The biggest news on this
front is that I was able to spend some time to <a href="/blog/2018/04/02/formal-cpu-bugs.html">formally verify the
ZipCPU as a whole</a>,
and then present some of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/doc/orconf2018.pdf">lessons I’d learned at
ORCONF2018</a>.  Perhaps
you’ve seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DHV_rJKSgo">the video of my
presentation</a>?</p>

<p>Since that time, I’ve had the opportunity to go back and rework the proof
of the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.  The proof is
now faster, cleaner, and “cheaper” (fewer clock cycles) than ever before.</p>

<p>That’s not all, though.  The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
now runs on its first <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">iCE40 board–the ICO
board</a>.</p>

<p>Other big improvements include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> now has a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/dcache.v">(formally
verified) data cache</a>!</p>

    <p>This is one of the first of several rather complex cores I’ve built where
I started with formal.  In hind sight, I’m not sure I could’ve built <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/dcache.v">this
data cache</a>
without <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a>.  If the
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15">Lord wills</a>,
I’ll have the opportunity to present <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/dcache.v">this cache
implementation</a>
here on this blog.</p>

    <p>I later came back to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/dcache.v">this
data cache</a>
and optimized it for single cycle reads and writes, although peripheral
writes are still multicycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/zipcpu/2018/12/20/sby-makefile.html">CPU proof now uses SymbiYosys
throughout</a>.  The
result is faster and cleaner, and easier to verify multiple separate
configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I finally fixed the bug in the CPU that was preventing the simulation
script from starting the CPU at any location other than the reset address.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found a way to optimize both the divide, and a regular <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/slowmpy.v">shift and add
multiply</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/slowmpy.v">optimized
multiply</a>
uses less than 50% of the original logic,
whereas the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/div.v">(now optimized)
divide</a>
uses about 20% less than before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/zipcpu/2018/01/31/cpu-build.html">ZipCPU toolchain</a>
now supports soft floating point via the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/libgcc">libgcc
library</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> remains a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/raw/master/doc/spec.pdf">highly
configurable CPU</a>.  Over this
last year, configuration options have been carefully changed from <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/cpudefs.v">internal
macros</a> to
parameters.  Such parameters are easier to control from the <a href="/zipcpu/2018/12/20/sby-makefile.html">external
environment</a>,
meaning that the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/cpudefs.v"><code class="highlighter-rouge">cpudefs.v</code>
file</a>
now only sets the CPU default options–the
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/12/20/sby-makefile.html">environment</a>
may still override them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the proofs have been rebuilt so that only the multiple clock
domain cores (not found internal to the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>) use the (now
superseded) <a href="https://www.clifford.at/yosys/cmd_clk2fflogic.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">clk2fflogic</code>
yosys option</a> option,
or its <a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#options-section"><code class="highlighter-rouge">multiclock on</code> SymbiYosys replacement</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If nothing else, I’d like to think that <a href="/blog/2018/04/02/formal-cpu-bugs.html">formally verifying a
CPU</a> now ranks
me among the category of those who know how to do
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal verification</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ri5cy">Ri5cy!</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.symbioticeda.com">SymbioticEDA</a>, I’ve now had the
opportunity to formally verify a CPU that wasn’t one of my own designs.
Using <a href="https://github.com/SymbioticEDA/riscv-formal">riscv-formal</a>, I
verified the <a href="https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv">Ri5cy soft core CPU</a>.
Yes, I did find discrepancies between the operation of the
<a href="https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv">Ri5cy core</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/SymbioticEDA/riscv-formal">riscv-formal</a> formal
property list.  Those have been delivered to the
<a href="https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv">Ri5cy</a> team,
and hopefully they have been fixed by now.  (I haven’t checked.)</p>

<p>It still floors me that I’ve managed to go from knowing nothing about
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal verification</a>
to <a href="/blog/2018/04/02/formal-cpu-bugs.html">formally verifying not only my own
CPU</a>,
but also <a href="https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv">someone else’s CPU</a>
in my first year of working with <a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en">SymbiYosys</a>.</p>

<p>Three thoughts come to mind.  First, I’m just getting started.  Second, this
has been a <em>lot</em> of fun.  Third, if a beginning FPGA developer can do it,
so can a more experienced one.</p>

<h2 id="autofpga">AutoFPGA</h2>

<p>If you aren’t familiar with
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>,
then just remember: this is the tool I use to compose designs together.
It is designed to make it easy to reconfigure a design, by adding or removing
a peripheral.  Unlike its Vivado or Platform Designer counterparts,
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
is open source, generates an open source interconnect, and does this
in a way where you can examine the source code of the process at every
step of the way.</p>

<p>While I use
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
religiously within <a href="/projects.html">my own projects</a>,
I’ll also be the first to admit that
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">the project</a>
isn’t all that mature.  It works well once a
project is set up that uses it, and it works well for pipelined
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone buses</a>.
It does not (yet) work well for any other types of buses,
and I already know that the interconnect it generates would not pass <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
verification (yet)</a>.</p>

<p>Still, <a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
has seen quite a few upgrades over 2018.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I recently <a href="/zipcpu/2018/12/22/autofpga-ld.html">blogged about the AutoFPGA linker script generation
upgrade</a>,
allowing it to create and support multiple types of linker scripts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While <a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
was designed from the beginning to allow a sort of script-inheritance,
I only started playing with it recently in my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty</a>
project.  I like it!  It makes creating <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">WB
scope</a>
scripts as simple as referencing the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/autoarty/auto-data/wbscope.txt">prior
script</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/autoarty/auto-data/flashscope.txt">only overriding the parts you need
to</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Constraint insertions</p>

    <p>In <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">one of my designs</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/enetpackets.v">ethernet
core</a>
runs at one clock speed and the core system clock speed at another.  This
has required the addition of many false paths into the constraint file
in order to support the <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">Wishbone
Scope</a> that <a href="/blog/2017/10/20/cdc.html">crosses
both clock domains</a>.
Even though the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/wbscope.v">Wishbone
Scope</a>
handles all of the <a href="/blog/2017/10/20/cdc.html">clock-domain
crossings</a> properly,
Vivado complains about them.  These false paths keep Vivado from
complaining.</p>

    <p><a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
can now copy false path constraints from a configuration file to the
constraint file when the core is inserted into the design, or remove
them from the constraint file when the core is removed from the design.
This keeps Vivado from complaining, and makes it easier to reconfigure
the design with a <a href="/blog/2017/10/20/cdc.html">cross-clock</a>
<a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">scope</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multiclock support</p>

    <p>Some time ago, <a href="/blog/2018/09/06/tbclock.html">we discussed what it took to get multi-clock support from
Verilator</a>.  This
technique is now working very nicely with 
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
in more than one design.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Most of my
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
work has involved the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB bus, version B4 in its simple pipelined mode</a>.
Currently,
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
only really supports this
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB bus</a>.</p>

<p>That said, <a href="/blog/2018/02/09/first-cyclonev.html">I’ve had to work with other bus structures as
well</a>.  As I’m sure
you will reflect, there is <a href="/blog/2018/02/09/first-cyclonev.html">nothing more painful to debug than a broken bus
structure: it can take down the entire design, to include any debug structures
you have for finding and catching
bugs</a>.  Therefore,
my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip">bus bag of tricks</a> now includes
formal properties for not only WB, but also the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/fav_slave.v">Avalon</a>
and <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite buses</a>.
This also includes <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/tree/master/rtl">various formally verified
bridges</a> between these
buses.</p>

<p>Perhaps you recall <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">how easy it was to verify an AXI-lite peripheral, and to
find bugs within Xilinx’s demonstration
design</a>?</p>

<p>If the <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15">Lord is willing</a>, I
hope to add the <a href="/doc/axi-spec.pdf">full AXI bus</a> to my
repertoire of buses I can formally verify with confidence.</p>

<p>I’d also like to build a set of formal properties that can be used to
formally verify my
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
bus interconnect.  I’m aware that there are some
subtle bugs within the interconnect as built, and I’d love to build a better
interconnect that could be formally verified to be bug free.  Specifically,
if you access more than one peripheral in the same bus cycle, you might
get your acknowledgments mixed or lost upon return.  If done properly,
this would place
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
one step above its competitors which can compose designs together, but cannot
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verify</a>
that the sum of the parts even works in the end.</p>

<h2 id="others">Others</h2>

<p>I’ve now counseled quite a few individuals on-line as they’ve worked
through their bachelor or even graduate theses.  Of those who have taken the
time to join me learning <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">Formal
Verification</a>,
none have been disappointed.  Here’s a quote from one particular
individual who was building first just a
<a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1250&amp;context=gradschool_theses">line-associative register set</a>, and then a full-blown
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4. A thankful student's experience</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/tweets/fl4shk-on-formal.png"><img src="/img/tweets/fl4shk-on-formal.png" alt="" width="954" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>There’s always a reason for <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
verification</a> in
digital design.  This person was the lucky one.
His design worked when he handed it in.</p>

<p>One other individual I remember started his journey on IRC and asked what
language he should learn.  I counseled him to learn Verilog, since the free
version of <a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>
works with Verilog.  He chose VHDL instead, since “Europeans
use VHDL more than Verilog”.  (Really??)  Two days after he started, he came
back on-line asking what was wrong with his design.  I then told him, had
he chosen to use the free
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal verification</a>
tools with Verilog, he would have had his answer right now.</p>

<p>What do you think?  Do you think I might be a bit biased?  Perhaps.  But my
bias is towards what has worked for me, and I’ve now found more bugs in
my own designs using
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>
than I found with any of my prior testing approaches.</p>

<h2 id="beginners-tutorial">Beginners Tutorial</h2>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 5. A slide from the FSM tutorial</caption><tr><td><a href="/tutorial"><img src="/img/2018-tutorial-ledsequence.png" alt="" width="462" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>While this remains a work in progress, I have put together the
<a href="/tutorial/">first six of what I hope will be about ten lessons for beginning digital
designers</a>.  These lessons tie
beginning level Verilog lessons together with
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">Verilator simulation and
co-simulation</a>
lessons and even introduce the topic of
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal verification</a>
as well.</p>

<p>My thesis behind this work has been that too many students take a course
in Verilog that teaches them only the semantics of the language and nothing
about the skills they actually need to do design.  Worse, the new student
spends too many hours learning Verilog, and as a result learns the Verilog
syntax to describe simulation as well.  On top of that, the student then
gets the two confused when he comes to building his first
complex design.  So rather than taking separate courses in Verilog,
simulation, formal verification, and then (finally) FPGA design, the
<a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a> I’m working on mixes
lessons from all four of these topics together in order to teach
FPGA design.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 6.  The tutorial remains a work in progress</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/work-in-progress.png" alt="" width="134" /></td></tr></table>

<p>While I haven’t had that much feedback from the
<a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>, those who have
contacted me have either said it was wonderful, or they’ve
given me the feedback necessary to make it better.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to completing

<h2 id="top-ten">Top Ten</h2>

<p>It’s now time to present the top ten articles on the ZipCPU blog from 2018!</p>

<p>The fact that this is my second year with the blog means there
are now two different measures I can use to determine what the top ten
articles are.  I could list the top ten articles written this year by their
number of hits, or I  could list the top ten articles by number of hits
regardless of when they were written.  Even better, can’t we do both?</p>

<p>So let’s start with the top ten articles written in 2018.  Along the way,
I’ll share how many hits each article has had, and how the article fairs
under a web-search for it.  I’ll use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>
for this purpose, since I’m afraid
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> knows me well enough to tailor the results
and so show the <a href="">ZipCPU blog</a> articles at the top of its
list.  Starting with number ten then:</p>

<ol start="10">
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2018/02/09/first-cyclonev.html">Debugging a Cyclone-V</a>, with 935 hits</p>

    <p>This year marked my first work with a Cyclone-V SoC+FPGA design.
I’m sure it will surprise no one to learn that it took a little more
creativity than normal to debug the design.  Having done that, there was
quite a surprise I found along the way.</p>

    <p>Searching
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> for “cyclonev debugging”
yielded this article as the number one result.</p>

    <p>This was one of my big <a href="/dsp/dsp.html">DSP</a> hits for
the year, proving that a signal
processing interpolator was nothing more than a convolution.  This is a
really big result for anyone into signal processing, simply because it
means that you can study your interpolation method in terms of the
Fourier transform of the filter representation of your interpolator.</p>

    <p>While I know I dig into some deep, difficult, and complex topics from time
to time, blogging about the ZipTimer was light and fun.  This article
followed the development of a counter all the way from being a simple
count-down counter, to an interval timer, to a programmable interrupt
timer peripheral.  As such, it has something for everyone from the
beginning designer on up to the SoC designer.</p>

    <p>Oh, and yes, I even went so far as to show how you might formally verify
the timer peripheral as well.</p>

    <p>This article was harder to find on 
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>.  It didn’t show up on either the
first or second page after searching for either
“FPGA interrupt timer” or
“programmable FPGA interrupt timer”.  It did show up as the number one
hit for “ZipTimer”, but that’s kind of cheating, so we won’t count that.</p>

digital design engineers out of <a href="/fpga-hell.html">FPGA
Hell</a>.  One of the more frustrating
positions to find yourself in is the one where everything works in the
simulation, but nothing works on the hardware.</p>

    <p>I’ll admit, writing about this article today feels like DeJa Vu all over
again, simply because I’m struggling with this problem even today on a
design I’m working with.</p>

    <p>A <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>

    <p>Thank you to all who have indicated an interest in the
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/01/01/zipcpu-isa.html">ZipCPU’s ISA</a>!  This
article presents a basic introduction to that ISA, explaining the basics
of how it is laid out.</p>

    <p>Unlike many RISC-based CPUs, the ZipCPU only has a 5-bit opcode space.
This limits the number of possible instructions to roughly 32. Of course,
a CPU is more than just its opcodes, so the article also presents the
register set of the ZipCPU, the basic form of an instruction’s operands,
how most instructions can be executed conditionally, and much more.</p>

    <p>It should come as no surprise that this is the top article returned
following a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> search for

    <p>Although it doesn’t show it on the hits for this page, this article really
starts out with a description of <a href="/formal/2018/07/14/dev-cycle.html">what formal development looks like in
practice</a>.  That
description goes over the development of this <a href="/2018/08/16/spiflash.html">SPI flash

<a href="/2018/08/16/spiflash.html">this essay describing the SPI flash
driver</a>, and what the
important parts to it are.</p>

    <p>In many ways, I’m rather surprised and flattered that this article was
so well received.</p>

    <p>Searching <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> for “spi flash controller”
yielded a touch of a surprise.  Their number one article referenced
my <a href="https://opencores.org/projects/qspiflash">Quad SPI Flash Controller on

    <p>To me, this <a href="/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html">asynchronous FIFO

or at least should have been one of the big hits of the year.  In many

a fourth place finisher.  An <a href="/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html">asynchronous

in so many designs, that any digital designer should really understand
how one is built.  Further, unlike <a href="http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO1.pdf">other presentations you might come
across</a>,
<a href="/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html">this presentation</a> also

    <p>Some of the readers of this blog had indicated that it felt like I was only
writing for hobbyists.  Because the focus of the blog has been on the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>, a design
built for low logic implementations, they felt that the tools and
techniques discussed here didn’t really apply well to the more
industrial applications they had come across in their experience.</p>

    <p>While this is far from true, I can understand how they came to this
conclusion.  One of my difficulties, as an author, is to present
a complete topic in each article.  This limits the things I might post
about to things that can fit, from beginning to end, within a single
article.</p>

    <p><a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">This FFT article</a>
pushed those limits.  While I didn’t discuss the FFT implementation in
its full gory detail, I did point out that 1) it had been formally
verified, 2) many of the pieces weren’t all that hard to do,
3) one or two were very hard, and 4) it discussed at a broad level how
I went about solving these issues.</p>

    <p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> apparently thought this article
was a hit, since it comes up as number two following a search for
“FFT generator.”  I’m not sure this is a good or bad thing, since I have
to imagine that most folks looking for an “FFT generator” are looking
for something like FFTW.  Still, I’m flattered.</p>

    <p>In many ways, this isn’t a fair comparison: this web-page isn’t really
an blog or article on it’s own, but rather a tree node pointing to several
tutorial PDFs.  Unlike the blog pages, someone might visit this tutorial
page many times over.  However, I’m including it here because the number
of hits on this page was relatively high compared to all of my other
blog articles.</p>

    <p>Looking for this page by searching on “verilog tutorial”
on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> found nothing.  On the other hand,
a search for “beginning Verilog tutorial” found this tutorial as number

    <p>Like the <a href="/tutorial">Verilog Beginner’s Tutorial</a>,
this isn’t really a blog post.  However, it did go viral this year after
someone posted it to Hacker News.  Because it got so much attention,
it only makes sense to list it here.</p>

    <p>How viral did this page become?  Well, you can see in Fig. 13 below.
Fig. 13 shows the distribution of <a href="">ZipCPU.com</a>

<p>It should come as no surprise that a search for “ZipCPU” using
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> yield’s the <a href="">blog</a>

    <p>As you may recall, a 
<a href="/dsp/2017/10/16/boxcar.html">boxcar filter</a> is a
very basic filter that just averages values together.  It’s a very basic
filtering component, one that is easy to build and easy to use.  This
article describes that component, and was apparently well received last
year.</p>

    <p>If you search <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> for “Moving average

    <p>This article traces many of the design choices I needed to make in order
to get a multi-processing system running on a Spartan 6/LX9.  It’s a fun
article, explaining the basics of what LUTs are and how to count LUTs
when reading your code.</p>

    <p>As I understand things, I think this particular article went viral last
year before I was counting page views.  By the time I started counting

comes back again as number nine.</p>

    <p>If you are doing DSP, you need a sine wave.  The standard

<p>The first obvious conclusion is that web hits are up.  The actual number
reflects a 60% increase in web hits over last year.  Thank you.</p>

<p>The next very fascinating conclusion is that the number of hits is very
cyclic on a weekly basis.  The blog gets many more hits Monday through
Friday than it does on Saturday or Sunday.  This tells me that the majority
of individuals looking at the <a href="">ZipCPU blog</a>
are professional developers, and not so much the hobbyists.  Thank you
again.  This is encouraging, although it wasn’t at all what I was expecting.</p>

<h2 id="happy-new-year">Happy New Year</h2>

<p>To all of have chosen to read and share this blog, and to all who have been
encouraged by it, let me wish you a hearty, “Thank You” and a “Happy New
Year”!  I’m looking forward to the year coming, and to continuing my

Lord as well, lest you find yourself stuck and wasting time in <a href="/fpga-hell.html">FPGA
