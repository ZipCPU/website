    <p>Okay, I’ll admit it, I’ve never used
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
for anything other than accessing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">DDR3 SDRAM</a> memory.  Even for that
I tend to use a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/blob/master/rtl/wbm2axisp.v">Wishbone (WB) to AXI
bridge</a>.</p>

<p>I have, however, looked for posts on both
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>’s and now
<a href="https://forums.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a>’s forums
that I might be able to answer.  It seems that
Xilinx’s
answer to most design problems is to create either a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBlaze">MicroBlaze CPU</a> or an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM CPU</a> (within a Zynq),
that you then connect to the rest of your design using their
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a></em>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1.  Xilinx Tech Support</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/crossbar/xiltech-support.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p><a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/axi_interconnect/v2_1/pg059-axi-interconnect.pdf">Xilinx’s interconnect</a>
is a general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbar_switch">cross bar switch</a>.
It “connects one or more <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
memory-mapped master devices to one or more memory-mapped slave devices.”
In general, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar switch</a>
allows any number of bus masters to access any number of bus slaves with the
(general) rule that only one master can talk to any given slave at a time.</p>

<p>This is all fine and dandy, but what happens when you want to simulate a design
that has an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a> within it?  <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/axi_interconnect/v2_1/pg059-axi-interconnect.pdf">Xilinx’s
crossbar</a>
is proprietary.  It won’t run in
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>.
Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBlaze">their
CPU</a>
is also proprietary, but we’ll leave that as a topic for a different discussion.</p>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to investigate how to build a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar switch</a>
of my own.  I built three of them: a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/wbxbar.v">Wishbone
crossbar</a>, an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilxbar.v">AXI-lite crossbar</a>,
and a full-up <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI4
crossbar</a>.  Today,
I thought I might share several of the more important points of these designs,
and perhaps even some lessons I learned while building them.</p>

<h2 id="crossbars-and-autofpga">Crossbars and AutoFPGA</h2>

<p>My own interest in building a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>
stems from my work with
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>.
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a> takes
a series of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
components, and connects them all together–much like either Vivado or Quartus
does but without the graphical user interface.  Each component is given its own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>, a set of
dedicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
connection wires, and then connected to a user-selected
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>.</p>

<p>This works great … when it works.</p>

<p>Sadly, I’ve had to work through some times when it hasn’t worked for me.
Often, I’ve mis-connected a slave to the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">interconnect</a>–perhaps not ANDing the address selection wire with the strobe, perhaps swapping
the stall and acknowledgment signals, whatever it is I’ve often ended up needing
to debug a piece of a design where the <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally
verified</a> core
meets some “<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">verified-by-simulation</a>”
logic.</p>

<p>My ultimate goal is to avoid these problems by <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally
verifying</a>
all of the parts and pieces of any design I create, to include those parts
that <a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
generates.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 2.  Crossing slaves mid-request</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/crossbar/double-ack-bug.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>One of my first problems is that <a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">my favorite interconnect
design</a>,
the same basic interconnect
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
builds, has a couple of limitations.  First, it can only handle a single bus
master at a time.  Multiple bus masters need to go through an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>
first
before they can get access to the bus.  We’ll come back to this again
in a moment.  Second, <a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">that
interconnect</a>
offers no protection against the case where a
bus master
crosses from one slave to another during a single bus interaction, as Fig. 2
illustrates on the left.  In this illustration, the first bus slave responds
two cycles after the strobe while the second slave responds one cycle later.
The responses might end up colliding, as shown in the figure, or even out of
order.  Worse, the third problem has to do with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>s.
If a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
is generated as I have things set up, the
bus master
will never know <em>which</em> request generated the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
and which request(s) have completed.</p>

<p>I was curious to know if I could do better.</p>

<p>At least, that was my first reason for being interested.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3. A Formal Property File can be the easiest way to start with formal verification</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/tweets/fpropfile.png" alt="" width="540" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Eventually, a second reason came into play as well:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">Interconnects</a>,
like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
bridges in general, make ideal tests of <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">formal bus property
files</a>.
Because you need the properties for both the slave and the master, you
essentially have to verify your properties back to back.  Are the master
bus property assumptions sufficient to drive the slave?  Are the slave
bus assumptions sufficient to satisfy the master’s assertions?</p>

<p>Finally, my last basic reason was that this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>
work was a lot of fun.  Indeed, I found them building these
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnects</a>, and particularly
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verifying</a>
them, to be a rather addictive challenge–even if it’s quite a time consuming
one.  Hey, we all have our hobbies, right?</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-crossbar">What is a Crossbar?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">Wikipedia describes a crossbar</a>
as a two-dimensional electrical structure where the source
comes in from one direction, and the outgoing connections go out a second.
While there’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">no picture offered currently on
wikipedia</a>, I’m going to use
Fig. 4 as my attempt to capture and explain this concept.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 4.  The Concept of a Crossbar Switch</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/crossbar/crossbar-switch.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In this figure, you can see a set of incoming electrical connections at the top,
and a set of outgoing electrical connections on the right.  At every crossing,
there’s a switch which may be closed to create a connection between any given
master and slave combination.</p>

<p>There’s two other things to note from this figure.  First, note that any
of the incoming signals can be connected to any of the outputs.  Second, note
that for an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NxN</code> array, all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> sources can be connected to a different
sink.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">Bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnects</a>
are very similar conceptually.  A series of
bus masters
are available as sources to drive one of several
bus slaves.  The biggest difference is that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">buses</a> typically have
many wires associated with them, and some of those wires are driven
with return values by the slave.  For example, a 32-bit
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a> requires roughly 164
separate wires to drive the slave, whereas the slave will respond with another
50 wires returned in response.  The
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a> is both much simpler, and
not nearly so full featured.  Wishbone transactions, therefore, can be
accomplished with only 106 separate wires, of which 71 are used to drive the
slave and 35 are returned in response.</p>

<p>As for how you might use one of these, consider as an example that the
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/02/12/zbasic-intro.html">typical ZipCPU design</a>
that has at least four separate
bus masters:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/18/wb-prefetch.html">instruction
fetch</a> unit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pipemem.v">data memory port</a>, handling any load or store instructions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/wbdmac.v">DMA</a> data transfer port</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/zipcpu/2017/08/25/hw-debugging.html">A debug port</a>,
through which the CPU can be <a href="/zipcpu/2017/07/14/cpu-debugging-needs.html">stopped, stepped, or reset and its registers
may be read</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Some of my
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> designs have more
masters as well, for example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">A Video display controller</a>
that needs to read from memory in order to create a pixel stream</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/fftdemo">A spectrogram raster, that writes FFT results from captured data to the
memory</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As I’ve currently built most of my <a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>
designs, I’ve used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2:1</code>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiters</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/ex/wbpriarbiter.v">such as this
one</a>
followed by a <a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1:N</code> interconnect</a>, as illustrated by Fig. 5.  (I did build a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip/blob/master/rtl/wbquadarbiter.v">4:1
arbiter</a>
once, but as I recall I’ve yet to use it.)</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 5. The ZBasic bus structure only allows a single master to ever drive the bus</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/crossbar/zipcpu-nocrossbar.svg" alt="" width="720" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Sadly, that means that any
bus master
can starve another by simply hogging the port.</p>

<p>To see how this might happen, consider an example from one of my first FPGA
projects what it would take to drive a video stream from a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">Basys3
board</a>.
The <a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">video driver</a> needed access
to the <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash</a> to read
(and then decompress) pixels so that they could be displayed on
<a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">VGA</a> output.
(There wasn’t enough RAM on or off chip for a proper screen buffer.)  Now
imagine that at the same time, the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">CPU</a>
wants to <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/18/wb-prefetch.html">read
instructions</a> from
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">block RAM</a>: the
<a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">video controller</a> needs the
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash</a>, and <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">the
CPU</a> needs the
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">block RAM</a>.
By going through an N:1
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>
first, or rather several <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/ex/wbpriarbiter.v">2:1
arbiters</a>
as I had actually implemented it, any time
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">the CPU</a>’s
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">block RAM</a>
request would get through the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/ex/wbpriarbiter.v">arbiter</a>
it would then force any
<a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">video</a>
requests to stall.  Worse, they might need to wait so long that the
<a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">video</a>
can’t read its pixel memory fast enough to display it.</p>

<p>This particular design was from before
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>.
The solution I eventually chose, shown in Fig. 6 below, was to place the
<a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">video</a>
memory controller <em>after</em> the main
<a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">interconnect</a>
in order to disconnect <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">the CPU</a> from
<a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">video</a>
memory if it didn’t need it.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 6. Placing the arbiter after the interconnect</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/crossbar/flash-v-video.svg" alt="" width="720" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Of course, this will only ever work as long as the
<a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">video controller</a>
only ever needs access to a single peripheral–in this case the
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash</a>.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand,
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">the CPU</a>
could access the
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">block RAM</a>
at the same time the video controller could access
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash</a>, then you have a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>—or at least that’s the
idea.</p>

<p>With <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">my new flash
controller</a>,
this might no longer be an issue–but it certainly
was back then with the older controller.  On the other hand, with the
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">old flash controller</a>,
I could only ever control a 640x480 screen–with the newer
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash controller</a>
I might be able to handle some better screen resolutions if I ever returned
to the project.</p>

<h2 id="the-key-an-nxm-arbiter">The key: an NxM Arbiter</h2>

<p>When building a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>, everything
comes down to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>
has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> ports for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> masters, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> ports for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> slaves.  Somehow, then,
a slave needs to get its data from one of the masters.  But which master?
That’s the task of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)">arbiter</a>.</p>

<p>There are several rules to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a> in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> The bus protocol must be obeyed.</p>

    <p>This is easily checked: all it requires is attaching a set of <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">formal bus
properties</a>
to every incoming or outgoing connection.  Since I have bus properties for
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a>,
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>, and even
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI</a>,
I could easily verify that each of my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/wbxbar.v">WB crossbar</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilxbar.v">AXI-lite crossbar</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI
crossbar</a>
maintained these properties for each connection.</p>

    <p>Having <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NM</code> identical master connections and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NS</code> identical slave connections
naturally lent itself to a lot of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loops within the design.  Normally I
avoid <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loops within digital design like the plague.  In this case, there
was no way around it if I wanted the interconnects to have a programmable
number of master and slave connections.</p>

    <p>To help deal with this, I used either the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genvar</code> index <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> or equivalently
the integer index <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iN</code> to refer to a connection to a bus master, while I
used either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iM</code> to refer to a connection to a bus slave.  I’ll
refer to these indexes often later, so remember <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NxM</code>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> will reference

  <li>
    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> No more than one master can be connected to any particular slave.</p>

    <p>I used a 2-dimensional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grant</code> variable to help express this.  This is
most easily understood by examining Fig. 7 on the right.  Imagine that
each switch’s status was represented by a single bit in this array.
In my terminology, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grant[N]</code> represents all of the connections associated
with all of the slaves that might connect to master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code>, shown in Fig. 7
as a vertical bar.  Fig. 7 shows what would happen if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grant[0][2]</code> were
set, connecting master numbered <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> to slave number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>.</p>

    <p>Using this 2-D <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grant</code> array, I could easily express this property that
no more than one master could ever be connected to more than one slave as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assert($onehot0(grant[iN]));</code> for every value of the master index, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iN</code>.</p>

    <p>In the <a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnects</a> I’ve built,
whether the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">full AXI4
interconnect</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilxbar.v">AXI-lite interconnect</a>,
I used two grant variables, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wgrant</code> for writes and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rgrant</code> for reads,
since the <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
protocol allows both writes and reads at the same time.</p>

<p>This wasn’t enough to keep the <a href="/blog/2017/06/12/minimizing-luts.html">synthesized logic simple and low
   cost</a>,
   so I created two other structures.  The first of these,  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mgrant[iN]</code>, was
   true if a particular master had been granted access to a slave–any slave.
   Essentially, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mgrant[iN]</code> was equivalent to the “OR” of all of the elements
   in the grant array for a particular master, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|grant[iN]</code>.</p>

<p>The second structure was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mindex[iN]</code>, which contained the index of the slave
   that master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iN</code> was connected to.  Hence, if ever <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mgrant[iN]</code> was true,
   then it must also be true that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grant[iN][mindex[iN]]</code> was also true.
   Perhaps you may recall <a href="/zipcpu/2019/03/28/return-decoding.html">the post discussing why this approach was so
   necessary</a> from
   some time ago.  This index-based reference was my solution to that problem.</p>

<p>This “solution” naturally led to another problem, what if you only have for
   example 5 slaves?  How many bits should be used for each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mindex</code> value?
   Well, three obviously.  However, that also meant that any time a value was
   referenced using the index, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slave_ack[mindex[N]]</code>, that a full 8
   values needed to be defined–even if I knew that only the lower 5 would be
   used.</p>

<p>All of these various data structures are tightly connected.  As I mentioned
   above, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mgrant[iN] |-&gt; (grant[iN] == 1&lt;&lt; mindex[iN])</code>.  There was also the
   corollary, that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!mgrant[iN] |-&gt; (grant[iN] == 0)</code>.  This helped to make
   certain that any logic I created kept these values properly synchronized.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 9. Quick loop up functions, slave's perspective</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/crossbar/sgrant.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> No more than one slave can be connected to any master.  Any unconnected
slave should neither receive requests nor send replies.</p>

    <p>To capture this, I created two new values: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sgrant[iM]</code>, which would be true
if slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iM</code> had been assigned to a master.  Remember how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mgrant[iN]</code> was
true if any switch in the columns of Fig. 2 above was closed?  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sgrant[iM]</code>
is the same thing, only acting across the rows.  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sindex[iM]</code> was the
slave side corollary for the master index, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mindex[iN]</code>, so that any time
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sgrant[iM]</code> was true, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grant[sindex[iM]][iM]</code> must also be true.
(That’s what the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> is intending to express in Fig. 9–evaluated
across all masters.  No, this is not valid syntax in any language I am
familiar with, but it fit in the figure.)</p>

    <p>Put together, any time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grant[N][M]</code> was true, then master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> was connected
to slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code>.  In that case, both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mgrant[N]</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sgrant[M]</code> would be true.
Further, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mindex[N]</code> would be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sindex[M]</code> would be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code>.</p>

    <p>Yes, keeping track of all of these values, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grant</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mgrant</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mindex</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sgrant</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sindex</code> took a lot of accounting.  As I mentioned above,
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
really helped.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 10. Pseudo-slaves to handle bus errors</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/crossbar/buserr.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> If a master requests an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
that doesn’t belong to any slave, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a> must send a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
in response.  Further, it must not send the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
response until any other valid responses have been returned, so enforcing
a strict ordering of operations on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>–something I
didn’t have before.</p>

    <p>This necessitated the creation of a special set of slaves, internal to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>, which would
respond to any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>s.  That meant
that the slave index, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> wouldn’t just go from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NS-1</code>, but rather
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NS</code> in order to reference the “no-peripheral mapped to this address”
slave.  You can see these extra slaves illustrated in Fig. 10 on the left.</p>

    <p>This special slave ID was unusual, since every master could connect to
the error slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NS</code> at the same time.  It’s as though there really were
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NS+NM</code> slaves, such as are shown in Fig. 10, rather than just the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NS</code>
slaves connected to the right of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>.  That way two
masters can be receiving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
responses at the same time without needing to wait for access to the special
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a> slave.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>
can’t change the grant for a given master while that master is waiting
for a response from a slave.</p>

    <p>This requires counters.  Every request accepted into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>
needs to increase that counter by one, whereas every response needs to
decrease the counter by one.  Once the counter reaches zero, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>
can tear down a given connection and set up a new one.</p>

    <p>Checking for whether or not the counter is empty is quite straightforward,
and I kept a set of flags I called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mempty[N]</code>, one for every master, to
indicate that there were no outstanding returns pending for that master.</p>

    <p>Before we leave this topic, though, let me ask: have you thought
about what would happen when the counter overflows?  I think we can all
agree that would be bad, but how should it be prevented?</p>

    <p>The easy answer would be to just add more bits to the counter to prevent
this from ever happening in the first place.  I mean, realistically, what’s
the likelihood that that a 32-bit counter of outstanding transactions would
ever overflow?  How about a 64-bit counter overflowing?</p>

    <p>I chose a different answer.  I chose instead to keep track of when the
counter was full, which I kept track of in another array <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mfull[N]</code>,  and
to stall a given master if accepting another
transaction would cause the counter to overflow.  This wasn’t as easy as it
sounds, since it took a clock to stop things before I made the
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffers</a> external.
That meant checking for when the counter was near overflow, and stalling if
there was already something in the pipeline at that time.  Once I made the
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffers</a> external,
this all got much easier.</p>

    <p>There’s also an unfortunate consequence of this rule: if ever a slave
misbehaves and doesn’t return a response, both the master granted access
to that slave and any other master attempting to access that slave will be
locked until a design reset.  Perhaps you’ll remember when I discussed having
<a href="/blog/2018/02/09/first-cyclonev.html">that problem in a DE-10 Nano
board</a>.  Finding a
bug is a challenge when the only way to get the board to respond to you
again is to reset it knowing that doing so will wipe away the information
you need to find the bug.</p>

  <li>
    <p>(<strong>Implementation Option</strong>:) A bus
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a> may generate an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
if ever a slave doesn’t respond to a request within a given amount of time.</p>

    <p>This follows from some ugly lessons I’ve had in the past when building
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
components.  Because I use a <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">bus based
“scope”</a>
to debug my design, if ever a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
component didn’t respond to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>,
the master might get stuck waiting for a response–and so I’d never be able
to access my “scope” to know what was going wrong.</p>

    <p>To deal with this, every
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone bus</a>
structure I’ve built includes a counter with a timeout.  That way, if an
errant slave refused to respond to a request (this was pretty common
before I started working with
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>),
the design wouldn’t freeze and I could still use the design to discover
what the fault was.</p>

    <p>Sadly, the way the <a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI
protocol</a> is structured,
this is really hard to do.  Eventually, I created <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axisafety.v">a separate AXI bus
component</a>
that I could use to bridge between the “trusted” bus master side and any
untrusted slave, returning a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
on any violation of the bus protocol by the slave.  Unfortunately, as
currently built, this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axisafety.v">AXI bus fault
isolator</a> also
limits the throughput of the bus–although not nearly as bad as <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">Xilinx’s
demo implementations do</a>.
Perhaps I’ll be able to come back later to fix this.</p>

<ol start="7">
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Every connection that can stall needs to be connected to a <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid
buffer</a>, as shown in
Fig. 12 above.  All of my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbars</a> have an incoming
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffer</a>, while
only the <a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
and <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbars</a> have return channel
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffer</a>s as well.</p>

    <p>Sadly, these sub-module <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid
buffer</a>s weren’t part of
my initial design approach.  In hind sight, they should’ve been.</p>

    <p>Initially, I instantiated every one of the <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid
buffers</a>
by hand within each
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>
I created.  I then verified each
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>
from the standpoint of the external connections.  This threw all of my
counters off, since I had to create an equation mapping the number of
outstanding transactions from the perspective of each master, to the
number of outstanding transactions from the perspective of each slave,
and the <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffers</a>
got in the middle of that.  If I failed to do so, the design would fail
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>.</p>

    <p>This book-keeping was quite painful.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, once I created and verified a separate 
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffer</a>
module, I went back and tore apart all of those painful
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal</a>
properties and rewrote them for simplicity.  Now, when verifying the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>,
the <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid
buffer</a>s have been
removed and replaced with simple pass-through logic.  The proof, I’ve
judged, is just as valid–since the
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffer</a>s have
already been verified separately.</p>

    <p>This almost worked, too.  There was one problem: The
bus abort capability I’ve written into all of my
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a> implementations.
Eventually, I convinced myself with a bit of bounded model checking that
this was working, although I haven’t come back to simulate these
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbars</a>
(yet) to see how they work.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Some particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
structures have more or less requirements than others.  For
example, <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">the way I implement
WB</a>, I insist that the
cycle line be dropped following any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>.
This then implements a bus <em>abort</em>, forcing any pending upstream
requests to be aborted and leaving any pending transactions in an uncertain
state.  Unlike <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a>,
<a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a> doesn’t support any
aborts.  However, <a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
also has <em>two</em> write channels that need to be synchronized: an
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a> write address
channel and an <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
write data channel–something
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a> doesn’t
need to deal with.  The
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI arbiter</a>,
whether <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">full</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilxbar.v">lite</a>,
needs to stall any write data channels in order to wait for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
to be given before it knows what slave to connect the write data channel to.</p>

<p>Still, most of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbitration</a>
code is the same across all three of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>s.  Care to take a peek?</p>

<h2 id="examining-the-arbitration-code">Examining the Arbitration Code</h2>

<p>Let’s look at the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/wbxbar.v">Wishbone
crossbar</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/7da3df3622404b6c0d90de1191ba0acf6af60310/rtl/wbxbar.v#L356-L471">arbiter</a>
and see how it’s done.  Both the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/7da3df3622404b6c0d90de1191ba0acf6af60310/rtl/axixbar.v#L754-L981">AXI</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/7da3df3622404b6c0d90de1191ba0acf6af60310/rtl/axilxbar.v#L558-L799">AXI-lite</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>s
have similar structures and logic, although in those cases the logic is
duplicated in order to handle the separate read and write channels.</p>

<p>The first step is to find out what master is requesting which slave.  Since this
code is common to all three
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>s,
it has been separated <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/addrdecode.v">into its own
file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addrdecode.v</code></a>.
The entire
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
decode operation is driven by the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/7da3df3622404b6c0d90de1191ba0acf6af60310/rtl/addrdecode.v#L44-L55"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SLAVE_ADDR</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SLAVE_MASK</code> parameters</a>.
These two parameters are each one-dimensional implementations of what
should properly be a 2d array.  There’s one entry of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AW</code> (address width) bits
per slave.  In order to match an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>,
the master’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
request must match the slave’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SLAVE_ADDR</code> for every bit where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SLAVE_MASK</code> is true.</p>

<p>We’ll start first with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">none_sel</code> flag though.  This flag is used to 
indicate that the requested
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
doesn’t match any slave’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
range.  To do this, we’ll run a check through a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop, checking
whether or not the requested
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
matches any of the possible
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
requests.  We’ll start by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">none_sel</code> high if ever there’s a valid
request, indicated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_valid</code>, and then clear it if any slave is found who’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a> matches.</p>

<p>That’s all of the hard address decoding work.  The rest of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/addrdecode.v">address
decoder</a>
just handles how these values are to be returned–whether they are to be
registered, or held at zero when nothing is requested, or both.</p>

<p>Once the addresses have been decoded to determine which slave is requested,
the next step is to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbitrate</a>
among potentially multiple masters all wanting access to the same slave.
For my implementations, I chose to do
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbitration</a>
on a priority basis.  In other words, if a
master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N2</code> requests a slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code>, the request will not be granted if some
other higher priority master, we’ll call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N1</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N1 &lt; N2</code>, has also
requested the same slave at the same time.  The array of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requested</code> values,
defined below, captures this idea.  If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requested[N][M]</code> is true, then some
other master with a higher priority than master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> has requested access to
slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code>.</p>

<p>Notice here that I cross-checked the request against those masters that could
properly respond to it.  That way if a master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N1</code> requests slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M1</code>,
but hasn’t yet finished getting the responses from slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M2</code> that it is
already connected to (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mempty[N1]</code> is clear), then a lower priority
master such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N2</code> will not be prohibited from connecting to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M1</code>.</p>

<p>Now that we have our address decoding and basic book-keeping out of the way,
we can look into what the actual
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbitration</a>
requires.  In this design,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbitration</a>
is done on a master by master basis using a variety of different

<p>Before assigning any slaves to a given master, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>
needs to know whether any current connection needs to remain connected and
unchanged.  In other words, if master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> has already been granted
access to slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code>, has master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> finished its business with that slave?
For that, we’ll check if this master is making additional requests of
the same slave that it has already been assigned to.  In the simple check below,
we check every master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> and every slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iM</code>.  If a grant has already been
made between master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> and slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iM</code>, and a new transaction request from
that same master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> is being made to the same slave slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iM</code>, then we want
to maintain this connection.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>That’s only the first reason why we might wish to stay on the channel and
maintain a given grant.  The other reason why we’d want to maintain a given
grant is if we are still expecting returns from it.</p>

<p>Handling this requires counting the number of transactions that have been
issued, minus the number of acknowledgments that have been returned.  A
variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mempty[N]</code>, set from the master’s perspective, contains whether
this count is zero or not.  Hence if this master has never been granted
access to a slave, or if a grant has been made but we’re still waiting
for responses, then we need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stay_on_channel</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">			<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">mgrant</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">mempty</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="p">])</span>

		<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The next step is to determine if the requested channel is even available.
In this case, if master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> is requesting channel <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iM</code>, that is if
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request[N][iM]</code> is true, and no other master has currently been granted access
to slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iM</code> so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sgrant[iM]</code> is false, and no other (prior) masters
are also requesting this channel, indicated when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requested[N][iM]</code> is low,
then this channel is available for reassignment.</p>

<p>We’ll only ever adjust any grant given to a particular master if that master

<p>The new variable introduced here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m_stb[N]</code>, is simply the strobe signal
output coming from the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/addrdecode.v">address
decoder</a>
shown in Fig. 12.</p>

<p>Since we’ve assigned slave number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NS</code> to reference the “no slave at that
address” channel, this simple logic above handles that grant as well.</p>

<p>I should also point out, getting this right took several iterations, and a
bit of learning along the way.  Earlier versions of this logic, such as <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/c9821fe23abf19a077afe56a9ad61942ab599c4f/rtl/wbxbar.v#L260-L306">this
one for example</a>,
were horrendous to follow and/or maintain.  Getting the design to be
properly simple–that’s taken some work.</p>

<p>From here on out, the rest of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>’s
work is book-keeping.</p>

<p>Well, not quite.  Did you notice how many clocks were required for that
processing?  One.  We calculated quite a few pieces of logic from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requested</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stay_on_channel</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requested_channel_is_available</code>, all the way to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grant</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mgrant</code> all on the same clock cycle.  Did  you catch that?
That’s a <em>lot</em> of processing for a single clock.  As a result, the more
slaves and the more masters get connected to this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>,
the slower it will become.  To keep this from ballooning out of control, both
the <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffer</a>s
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/addrdecode.v">address
decoder</a>
have configuration options to add clock cycles in order to break up the
any paths leading into to this critical path.</p>

<p>There’s also a big difference at this point between
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a> and
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>.
Unlike <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>,
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
has separate channels for write
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
and write data.
According to the specification, the data in these channels may arrive at any
time and in any order.  The write data, for example, might arrive first
and then the write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
or vice versa.  However, the data cannot be routed to the correct slave until
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a> is known and has
been properly decoded.  Therefore the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">interconnect</a>
must stall the write data channel, should it arrive at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a> early, until the write
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
is provided, decoded, and a grant is given.  Once a grant has been provided,
it must remain active until all of the write data associated with that grant
has been accepted.  With
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI</a>,
that means that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>
must wait until the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WVALID &amp; WLAST</code> signal has been received before
any write grants referencing this master-slave combination may change.  With
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilxbar.v">AXI-lite</a>,
that also means that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>
must wait until the write data channel has caught up to the write
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>
channel before adjusting any write grants.</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-slave-outputs">Setting the slave outputs</h2>

<p>At this point, all the difficult processing has been done.  All that remains
is to reap the rewards from this hard work.</p>

<p>For example, we can now set our
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
outputs to drive the various slaves.  To do this, we’ll loop through
every slave channel, and adjust the associated

<p>These particular values, however, are the easy ones: they aren’t the control
signal values, but rather the values that are qualified by the control signal
values themselves.  As a result, if the valid signal (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_sstb[M]</code> for
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xVALID</code> for
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>)
is low, these become don’t care values.</p>

<p>The control signals are a touch more complicated.</p>

<p>First, in order to support a bus abort capability, we abort any transaction
following either a reset or a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
return from the slave.</p>

<p>The last step of implementing the bus abort is to drop the slave’s
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>
cycle line any time the master drops his.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sgrant</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">])</span>

<p>Otherwise, if we aren’t aborting a transaction and a grant has been made then
we must be in the middle of a valid transaction.  The slave’s cycle line
needs to be set to reflect that.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">			<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">begin</span>
				<span class="n">o_scyc</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The strobe signal is more complicated.</p>

<p>As you may remember, the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a>
strobe signal indicates a transaction request, whether for read or write, and
that it is roughly analogous to the
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>)
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AxVALID</code> signals.  The first rule of any request is that the request cannot
change as long as another one is outstanding.  For this reason, we wrap the
control logic so that any time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_sstb[M] &amp;&amp; s_stall[M]</code>, that is any time
the slaves strobe and stall signals are both high, nothing gets changed.
If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(!o_sstb[M] || !s_stall[M])</code> just reflects the opposite using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws">De Morgan’s laws</a>, such
that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
values may legitimately be changed without dropping any requests.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">				<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">o_sstb</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">s_stall</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That was the easy part.</p>

<p>The difficult part about the strobe signal is that we can’t just set it to
the master’s strobe input, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m_stb[sindex[M]]</code>.  We have to first check that
the master is still requesting this particular slave, such that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request[sindex[M]][M]</code> is still true.  Remember, one of the bugs we are hoping
to fix by creating this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>
is associated with a master accessing a second
slave before the first has had a chance to respond.  In this case, we can
check both by simply checking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request[sindex[M]][M]</code> since the request
signal will never be high unless <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m_stb[sindex[M]]</code> is also high.</p>

<p>The unusual requirement is that we also need to check that the channel isn’t
already too full.  Remember the comment about using counters to count
transactions, and the requirement that the counters cannot overflow?  If the
counter is about to overflow, then the channel is full.  We can’t issue
another transaction in that case, but rather need to wait for some returns
to come back first.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">					<span class="n">o_sstb</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">sindex</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">]][</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">]</span>

			<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, if there’s been no grant to this slave at all, then both cycle line
and strobe line’s can be cleared.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">begin</span>

	<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">endgenerate</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ve now decoded the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>,
and connected the slave to the master requesting
a connection.  We’ve even sent the details of the request to the slave.  What
we haven’t done is return any of the details from the slave back to the master.
That’s the next step.</p>

<h2 id="returning-values-to-the-master">Returning values to the master</h2>

<p>There are two types of values that need to be returned to the master.  The
first is are the acknowledgments and data returned from the slave.  With
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a>,
these are easy.  We can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mindex[]</code> as a pointer to just
copy the slave’s return values to the master.</p>

<p>The stall signal is a bit more involved, just because there are more reasons
why we might stall.  We default the stall signal to one, then allow it to be
cleared <em>if</em> the we have an active grant to a given slave, <em>and</em> a request to
that slave, <em>and</em> if that slave isn’t also stalled.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">				<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mgrant</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="p">])</span>

<p>However, if the channel is full–that is if our counter is near rolling over,
then we need to stall this channel as well.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">				<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mfull</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="p">])</span>

<p>As with many things, there are exceptions.</p>

<p>For example, if the master has requested a non-existent
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a>, or if
the transaction has timed out, then we need clear the stall line, accept
a transaction, and return a

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, this timeout signal only works because of the bus <em>abort</em> capability
implemented within the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB standard</a>
I use.  It doesn’t work on the
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>s.</p>

<p>Finally, if the master drops his cycle line, aborting any ongoing transactions,
then we need to make certain that nothing more gets returned.  Any ongoing
transactions will be left in an undetermined state.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">				<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">m_cyc</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="p">])</span>

				<span class="k">end</span>
			<span class="k">end</span>
		<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I use this bus abort capability primarily for two reasons.  First, following
any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>,
the master will naturally want to abort any ongoing transactions.  This
implementation was chosen from the perspective of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>.
If a software program receives a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a> doesn’t really
care what other transactions might succeed or fail–the software program has
already failed.  This simplifies the cleanup.  The same is true of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/wbdmac.v">DMA</a>:
following any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>,
the correct answer is to abort any efforts at further transactions.</p>

<p><a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>,
however, doesn’t have a way of signaling a bus abort condition, nor does
it have a way of implementing one: every transaction request <em>must</em> receive a
response.  This includes burst read responses as well–the
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
bus is still required to return every beat of a burst read response even if all
of them will indicate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>s.</p>

<p>This lack of a bus abort makes implementing a timeout difficult.  Imagine, if
you will, that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>
detects a broken channel.  Perhaps the
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI slave</a>
has failed to return a response, or perhaps that response is to an
ID for which nothing is pending, or perhaps it sets the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xLAST</code> flag too early,
either way, there’s no way to recover since there’s no way to indicate to the
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI slave</a> that the master
wishes to discard anything it might still wish to respond to.</p>

<p><a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a> doesn’t have that
problem since all the master needs to do is to deassert the cycle line
for the slave to know to reset any transactions in progress.</p>

<p>The way to handle this properly is to assign a timeout counter to every
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a> burst.  Then, if the
slave fails to respond or responds inappropriately, <em>every response following</em>
is to be held as an error.  This is how my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axisafety.v">AXI bus fault
isolator</a>
worked initially.  The reason for this approach is simply that there’s no way
to know if a response, following an error of some type, is to be treated as a
valid response or a continuation of the fault.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that there’s no way to recover.</p>

<p>This is why I went back and updated the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axisafety.v">AXI bus fault
isolator</a>
to add to it the ability to reset the entire (broken) downstream core, using
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXI_ARESETN</code> signal.  Once the downstream slave then comes back from
the reset condition, it is reattached to the bus.  Until that time, as long
as it is either in the fault condition or in the reset condition, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axisafety.v">AXI
bus fault
isolator</a>
simply returns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>s for every transaction
request.</p>

bus property file to every connection coming in or going out of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>,
as shown in Fig. 13.  We’ve already discussed this property file for both
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a> and
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a> on the blog.
In general, having such a file makes it really easy to verify that a given
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
component obeys the rules of the road.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 13.  Bus property files are connected to each of the input and output buses</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/crossbar/composing-bus-properties.svg" alt="" width="540" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The difficult part of this task is
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>.  In
order to pass
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>,
the internal state variables of each formal property file need to be
related to the registers within the design, and to the state variables found
in each of the other formal property files.</p>

<p>For example, consider the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a> bus.
The <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">formal property file</a>
maintains a counter of outstanding transactions in order to be able to make
certain that 1) every request gets a response, and 2) that no responses are
issued without a prior request.  These counters need to be matched.  For
example, suppose master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> is connected to slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code>, so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grant[N][M]</code>
is true.  In that case, the number of outstanding transactions from the
perspective of the master must be matched to the outstanding transactions
counter within the slave.</p>

<p>This isn’t as trivial as it sounds.</p>

<p>Transactions issued by the master might be waiting in the decoder.  Similarly,
transactions in any
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffer</a>s
need to be counted.  In the end, you need to have an assertion that
one value, based upon the master’s transaction counter, equals a similar
value based upon the slave’s transaction counter.</p>

<p>Let’s see if we can make any sense of how this is done.  Within
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/wbxbar.v">this design</a>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_moutstanding[N]</code> is the counter containing the number of outstanding
transactions from the perspective of the master, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_soutstanding[M]</code>
contains the same counter from the perspective of the slave.</p>

<p>The check itself is done across all masters.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">generate</span> <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">N</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">NM</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">N</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">N</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>

		<span class="c1">// ...</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The first step is to make certain that the master’s transaction count includes
at least enough to keep our arithmetic from overflowing.  This means that
if there’s a valid transaction coming out of the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/addrdecode.v">decoder</a>,
and if the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/addrdecode.v">decoder</a>
outputs were registered, then it must be accounted for in the master’s count.
Similarly, if the return response is being buffered, then there must be
a value in the master’s counter accounting for the valid value in that
buffer as well.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>We can now subtract these two values from the master’s counter to create
a new value, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n_outstanding</code>, containing the number of transactions that have
been sent to the slave.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>The last step is to match this count to the slave’s count.  So, we’ll
loop through all possible slave connections.  For any bus master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code>
connected to slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code>, this number of outstanding transactions is required
to match the number of outstanding slave transactions.  Well, almost.  The
slave hasn’t yet counted any transaction it hasn’t yet accepted.  It might
also be that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_scyc[iM]</code> (the slave’s cycle line) is low, or an error
received and so the slave has aborted its transaction but the master hasn’t
yet aborted it, etc., etc.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>The key here is that this assertion <em>must be an assertion of equality</em>.
If the two counters are not related to each other <em>exactly</em>, the
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
engine is guaranteed to fail.  (I should know–I keep trying to use inequalities
for this check, and then getting corrected by the solver.)</p>

<p>With <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>,
this check is just a touch more involved.  Unlike
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>,
there’s no bus abort.  Unlike
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a> which has only
the one counter, 
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a> requires
counters for the number of outstanding read transactions, write address
and write data transactions.
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI</a> has even more state
to track, in order to make certain that the number of transactions with a
given ID, and the number of beats per burst, all match the data within the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>’s internal registers.</p>

<h2 id="crossbar-options">Crossbar Options</h2>

<p>One of the annoying realities of these separate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>s
is the options
they can be configured with.  Sure, there’s the easy options: the number of
masters, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NM</code>, and the number of slaves, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NS</code>, are both configurable.  The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address">address</a> ranges
of the various slaves are configurable as well.  Further, as you’ve gathered
from above, the size of the counters used to determine how many transactions
are outstanding is also adjustable.  The size of this counter is controlled
by the parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LGMAXBURST</code>.  After that, though, I started to get greedy.</p>

<p>The first option I created was the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPT_LOWPOWER</code> option.  This option is
common to all three of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a>s.  The jury is still
out regarding whether this is useful or not (I haven’t measured it), however
many bus lines can travel long distances on a chip.  If the lines can be held
at zero any time they are not in use, that is any time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cyc</code> is zero for
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AxVALID</code> is zero
for <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>, then no energy
needs to be spent to charge those
lines.  This comes at the cost of extra required logic, but I still think it
might help lower the overall power required.  I’m looking forward to measuring
if this has any effect.</p>

<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/wbxbar.v">WB
crossbar</a>,
there’s also an option to register the return values from the
slave, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPT_DBLBUFFER</code>.  There’s also the option of setting a timeout,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPT_TIMEOUT</code>, so that any return
that doesn’t come back in time for the timeout can be turned into an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
and a subsequent bus abort.  Here, I got greedy again.  I added an additional
register to control whether or not a request should timeout <em>before</em> it even
gets to the slave.  This I call a starvation timeout, and its an indication
that a particular master isn’t getting access to the slave fast enough.
Perhaps another master is hogging the slave.  Perhaps it’s a well used slave
and this master doesn’t have enough of a priority.  Either way, with the
starvation timeout parameter set, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPT_STARVATION_TIMEOUT=1'b1</code>, each master
will be guaranteed a return in a fixed and known number of time-steps.</p>

<p>If only I could do that with
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>.
Although I haven’t done that with the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilxbar.v">AXI-lite
crossbar</a>,
that might be easy enough to be doable still.</p>

<p>One of the parameters the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilxbar.v">AXI-lite</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbars</a> share that the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/wbxbar.v">WB crossbar</a>
doesn’t have is a linger option, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPT_LINGER</code>.  The idea behind this option is
that if master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> has just finished talking to slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code>, then that connection
is likely to be needed again in the near future.  Once the channel becomes
idle, therefore, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>
will wait <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPT_LINGER</code> clocks before removing the grant.  If master <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> wants
to talk to slave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> again, the grant is already there waiting for him and
he won’t have to wait for it.  Of course, it will
only linger if no other master wants access to this particular slave.  This is
therefore a useful, though optional, configuration parameter which might
impact performance.</p>

<p>Of course, the sad reality of any of these options is that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">crossbar</a> really needs to be
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">verified</a>
for every possible parameter setting.  Hence verifying the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/wbxbar.v">WB crossbar</a>
requires 48 proofs (36 assertion based, 12 cover based), whereas the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilxbar.v">AXI-lite crossbar</a>
requires 12 proofs (6 assertion based, 6 cover based).  The full
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI crossbar</a>,
as currently configured, requires 8 assertion based proofs.  This is really
incomplete, since it doesn’t (yet) have a set of cover-based proofs
to show that not only will it not violate any properties, but that it can
actually properly complete transactions in the first place.  For now, though,
you can just consider this last piece a work in progress–even though I’ve
done enough testing with various <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cover()</code> checks to be confident that
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI
crossbar</a>,
would work.</p>

<h2 id="xilinxs-interconnect">Xilinx’s Interconnect</h2>

<p>Once I had formally verified my own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnects</a>, I became curious
about how hard it might be to <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally
verify</a> <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/axi_interconnect/v2_1/pg059-axi-interconnect.pdf">Xilinx’s AXI
interconnect</a>.
If you check out Vivado’s IP Catalog, you’ll find an entry for a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AXI interconnect RTL</code> which, when instantiated, will create a Verilog copy
of their <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/axi_interconnect/v2_1/pg059-axi-interconnect.pdf">their
interconnect</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 14. Xilinx offers an interconnect in their IP catalog</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/crossbar/xilinx-intercon-ip.png" alt="" width="781" /></td></tr></table>

<p>I spent some time looking through this (after I’d built <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">my
own</a>)
and I’ve learned a lot from it.</p>

<p>First, they have two different types of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnects</a>
implemented.  The first type offers grants to slaves based upon read or write
requests.  This is different from my own grants above which are based upon
either write requests or read requests.  In other words, if you request
to read from a peripheral from this first type of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>, you’ll get a
write grant as well.  It’s not yet clear to me what will happen if you request
both read and write grants at the same time, though.  This particular
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a> ignores the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AxID</code>
values when routing–much like <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">my
own</a>.  Not only
that, this version of Xilinx’s
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a> might easily
mask the <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI</a> bugs found
in their demonstration slave core.</p>

<p>The other type of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>
they support grants access to both read and write requests separately, and
uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AxID</code> field to route the returns back to the slave that requested
the transaction.  This was how I had always thought an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI
interconnect</a> would
be created–that is, until I tried building my own.  The reason why I don’t
route bus returns based upon the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BID</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RID</code> fields is simply because you’d
need another
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>–this
time for the return channel.  The first
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>
already costs a minimum of two clock cycles of latency.  This second
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)#Bus_arbiter">arbiter</a>
would need to consume a similar amount of resources on the return.  Adding
four clocks to every transaction seems excessive.  So, while it’s doable,
I didn’t find it worth the performance cost.</p>

<p>The other thing I found while browsing Xilinx’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a> code, were a large
number of translators that could bridge from one bus type to another.  Their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Crossbar_switch">interconnect</a>
it seems is capable of instantiating <a href="/blog/2017/10/20/cdc.html">clock domain
crossing</a> bridges, bridging from
AXI3 to <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a>,
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>
to <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a>,
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a>,
to <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>,
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a> with one size
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AxID</code> values to <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a> with
another, and so on.  It’s quite configurable, although the small budget
hobbyist should beware: each of these translations costs resources within
your design.</p>

<p>Of those bridges, the one that surprised me was the
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a> to
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a> bridge.
Whereas <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a> is a
very capable protocol, capable of high speed operation just as fast if not
faster than the full <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a>
protocol, Xilinx’s bridge code crippled the
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a> generated
transactions so that no more than one read or one write would ever be
outstanding at any given time.  The bridge also cost several clock cycles,
which is unusual since an
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a> transaction can be
created from an <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>
transaction by <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilite2axi.v">fixing and ignoring the unused
fields</a>.
No matter how I looked it over, I couldn’t see any reason for building their
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a> to
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a> bridge in this
fashion.</p>

<p>Perhaps this explains why the bugs in their
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>
demonstration core have gone unnoticed for so long?</p>

<p>The sad reality, however, of both of these observations is that some day
Xilinx will update <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/axi_interconnect/v2_1/pg059-axi-interconnect.pdf">their
interconnect</a>,
and all of a sudden a lot of <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI
slaves</a>, written based upon
their <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">demonstration code</a>,
will start failing.</p>

<p>I guess that means that if you haven’t started
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verifying</a>
your
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
components, you should start doing so now.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Building your own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)">crossbar interconnect</a>
may be intense, but it is certainly possible to do.  I will say this, though,
I’m not sure I could’ve done it without the formal property files for either
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>,
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>,
or the <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">AXI4</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a> protocols.</p>

<p>I should also mention that the proofs themselves aren’t necessarily all that
fast to accomplish.  While the
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal</a>
tools can often find bugs quickly, proving that there are no bugs can be much
harder.  As a result, my initial development on each of these
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)">crossbars</a> was
pretty quick.  It then slowed down.  At one point, it took over 50 hours
to verify the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI
crossbar</a> in one
of its configurations.  Creating submodules to contain the <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid
buffer</a>s really helped,
dropping the maximum proof time down to 22 minutes.  Sure, it takes time, but
it’s quite doable.</p>

<p>The biggest thing I haven’t discussed about full
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)">crossbar interconnects</a>
is their logic cost.  That full
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbiter_(electronics)">crossbar</a>
doesn’t come cheap, and certainly not for any sizable number of masters or
slaves.  Worse, the cost doesn’t scale linearly as the number of masters or
slaves increases.  Instead of opening that discussion now, let me simply invite
you to take any of the arbiters discussed here and to build it using
<a href="">Yosys</a>
to see how much it will cost as you vary the parameters.</p>

<p>Finally, I would still like to come back to this topic and walk through some
of my brand new <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI</a>
cores: the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axisafety.v">bus fault
isolator</a>, the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axi2axilite.v">AXI to AXI-lite bridge</a>, the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilite2axi.v">AXI-lite to AXI bridge</a>, or perhaps even the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/wbm2axisp.v">Wishbone to AXI</a>
bridge that I use to get high speed access to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">DDR3 SDRAM</a> memory.  These we’ll do
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/heb/6/3">if the Lord permits</a>.</p>
