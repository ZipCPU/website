    <p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>

<p>It’s now 2018.  Shall we take a quick look at the
top 10 posts from 2017?  In case you missed them, here’s a recap:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/08/04/debouncing.html">How to eliminate button bounces with digital logic</a></p>

    <p>This page, showing how to handle debouncing buttons, received <strong>1,178</strong>
hits in 2017.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/dsp/2017/09/15/fastfir.html">Building a high speed Finite Impulse Response Digital Filter</a></p>

    <p>This page may have been the first real introduction to FIR filtering on
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/">ZipCPU.com</a>, offering more details
than the <a href="/dsp/2017/08/19/simple-filter.html">initial, two-simple
filters</a>
article presented.  It described how to build a generic FIR filter within an
FPGA.</p>

    <p>Although the blog has since moved on to discuss <a href="/dsp.html">many other filtering
implementations</a>, this basic article was a
winner that received <strong>1,284</strong> page views in 2017.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/dsp/2017/08/30/cordic.html">Using a CORDIC to calculate sines and cosines in an FPGA</a></p>

    <p>Although the CORDIC algorithm really isn’t anything new, this was still
a winning article as it helped to explain to many how a CORDIC operates.
As a result, this article received <strong>1,347</strong> page views in 2017.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a></p>

    <p>This simple and short essay describes the reality that many FPGA developers
have found themselves within: the code builds, it synthesizes, it can be
placed onto an FPGA, but once there it doesn’t work.  It also offers some
approaches for getting out of FPGA Hell as well.  This well loved
article received <strong>1,375</strong> page views in 2017.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/10/13/fpga-v-asic.html">FPGAs vs ASICs</a></p>

    <p>Thanks to a conversation with a friend at
<a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a>
this year, I learned that ASIC development is very different from FPGA
development.  Sure, they both share Verilog or VHDL as a base language,
and they
both use digital logic, but they are also <em>very different</em> disciplines.
This article focuses on and describes those differences.  It received
<strong>1,427</strong> page views in 2017.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/18/wb-prefetch.html">Building a prefetch module for the ZipCPU</a></p>

    <p>I guess I wasn’t expecting this article to end up on the top-ten list this
year when I wrote it.  It only describes a very simple prefetch module
for the ZipCPU, not the fastest or the best prefetch module.  Perhaps it
was because it showed how a prefetch module could interact with a CPU,
or perhaps it was because it showed how a prefetch module could be
formally verified.  Either way, this article ends up at number 6, with
<strong>2,003</strong> page views during 2017.</p>

    <p>Indeed, since this topic was so well received, I am looking forward to
posting about the ZipCPU’s <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pfcache.v">prefetch and cache
module</a>,
and how that module may also be formally proven, in 2018.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/10/20/cdc.html">Some Simple Clock-Domain Crossing Solutions</a></p>

    <p>This post discusses several different approaches to simple clock domain
crossings.  It discusses what clock domain crossings is, and when you need
a clock domain crossing solution in the first place.  This article received
<strong>2,152</strong> page views.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">My first experience with Formal Methods</a></p>

    <p>This post discusses my first experiences with using formal methods via the
open source <a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys">yosys</a> program and the
associated yosys-smtbmc program.  I applied these methods to a FIFO.  Much
to my surprise, the formal methods found bugs in my “working” FIFO
implementation that I had never found using a traditional test bench
methodology.</p>

    <p>This post received <strong>5,936</strong> page views in 2017.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/08/21/rules-for-newbies.html">Rules for new FPGA designers</a></p>

    <p>At the beginning of the fall 2017 semester, I put together a list of
“rules” and pieces of advice for new FPGA designers.  While these rules
were hotly debated on the Hacker News website, they will still help to
keep new FPGA designers out of a lot of debugging troubles.</p>

    <p>This post received <strong>11,530</strong> page views.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/09/18/clocks-for-sw-engineers.html">Clocks for Software Engineers</a></p>

    <p>The one post that received more page views than any other was the <a href="/blog/2017/09/18/clocks-for-sw-engineers.html">Clocks for
Software Engineers</a>
post.  This post examines many of the common problems that software
engineers have when trying to “program” in Verilog or VHDL.  It discusses
the impact of for loops, and why the clock is so important.</p>

    <p>In general, I make it a point not to post any of my articles to any news
aggregators.  This is based upon the Bible verse:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and
not thine own lips. (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/pro/27/2">Prov 27:2</a>)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Doing this also allows me to evaluate how well a particular article was, or
was not received.  If someone feels that the article was well written enough
to post to an aggregator, then that tells me something about my audience.</p>

    <p>It may have been about four days after I posted this article when someone
read it and posted it on Hacker News.  I was sitting at my desk at the time
watching Google Analytics while doing other work when suddenly the number
of page views spiked from 0-3 at a time to upwards of 700 views at once.
(It’s probably more accurately a block average over a minute or two, but it
shows on the screen as though they were all at once.)  I then looked to find
the article on Hacker News: it was <em>the top article</em> for several hours that
night.  Since then, it has often remained the top article people have read
on a week by week basis.</p>

    <p>This article tops the zipcpu.com charts at <strong>57,033</strong> page views in 2017.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you find you’ve missed any of these articles, feel free to go back and read
what others have enjoyed so much this year.</p>

<p>From my standpoint, I find these top ten articles, together with any
e-mails from my <a href="https://patreon.com/ZipCPU">Patreon supporters</a>, are a guide
to what topics might interest FPGA developers in the future.
For example, based upon this list I’ll probably discuss some other
(better?) approaches to sine-wave generation in this new year, how to build
(and verify) a prefetch with an integrated cache, an asynchronous FIFO
implementation, how to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">simulate a display</a>
using Verilator, and much more–but only if the
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15">Lord is willing</a>.</p>
