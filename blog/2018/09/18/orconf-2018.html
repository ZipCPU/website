    <p>It’s time again for <a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a>!  For those who are not
familiar with <a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a>, I like to think of it as the
premier conference discussing <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org">Free and Open Source Silicon
(FOSSI)</a>.  You can read more about the
<a href="https://orconf.org">conference here</a>, or even read the <a href="https://orconf.org/#presentations">abstracts of the
presentations here</a>,
although this latter link is likely to go stale before ORCONF-2019.
<a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a> tends to be a small conference, and nothing like
the giant IEEE conferences I’ve been to in the past.  I see this as a good
thing, because it means I will actually have a chance to meet and say hello
to everyone there.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><tr><td><img src="/img/verilator_256_200_min.png" alt="" width="256" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This year, among the many wonderful presentations that I lined up, I am
especially looking forward to <a href="https://www.veripool.org/users/3">Wilson
Snyder</a>’s presentation on a multithreaded
version of <a href="https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Intro">Verilator</a>.
That could really transform my simulations!</p>

<p>Here’s his abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> 4.0 - Open Simulation Goes Multithreaded</p>

  <p>The primary author of
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>, the open source
high-speed Verilog simulator, announces fresh for this meeting
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> 4.0 with
multithreading, and how you can get your designs the fast(est),
free simulation.</p>

  <p>Presented by <a href="https://www.veripool.org/users/3">Wilson Snyder</a>, one of the
primary authors of Verilator.</p>
</blockquote>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><tr><td><img src="/img/orconf-2018-title.png" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>I will also be presenting this year, as I have the last two.  My title is:
Lessons learned while formally verifying the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.v">ZipCPU</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> is a three-year old CPU
and <a href="/zipcpu/2018/01/01/zipcpu-isa.html">ISA</a> designed for
low logic FPGA’s.  One of the challenges of any CPU design, to include the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>, is coming up with a
sufficiently robust test suite to exercise all of the possible logic flows
within <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/zipcpu.html">the CPU</a>.  While <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a> can be used
for this task, they are traditionally viewed as too computationally
expensive to formally verify something as complex as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>.</p>

  <p>Contrary to this view, the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
has now been formally verified using
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>.  As a result,
<a href="/blog/2018/04/02/formal-cpu-bugs.html">many bugs have been found and
fixed</a>-bugs not
found previously using <a href="/zipcpu/2018/02/12/zbasic-intro.html">canned test
cases</a>.  Not only
that, it has also <a href="/formal/2018/07/21/zipcpu-icoboard.html">become easier to
modify</a> <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/zipcpu.v">the core
CPU</a> as
necessary to achieve lower logic utilization, knowing that the solver will
find any bugs in the updated implementations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you haven’t chosen to join us at <a href="https://orconf.org">ORCONF</a>, then rest
assured the staff are really good at posting the various presentations later.
I will also post a copy of my slides on GitHub and link to them here, <a href="/blog/2017/09/12/orconf-2017-return-home.html">as I
did last year</a>.
This is a small consolation, though, for missing the richness of actually
meeting and discussing digital design topics with the likes of those who
will be attending, or the opportunity to ask questions of the speakers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you will be joining us, then please take a moment to
introduce yourself!  I’d love to have the opportunity to meet those who
have encouraged me over the last couple of years.</p>
