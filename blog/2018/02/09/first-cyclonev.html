    <p>If you’ve read the description of <a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist
Technology</a>,
you’ll remember that <a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist
Technology</a>
is a services business.  I use
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/">this blog</a>
and my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU">demonstration IP cores</a>
to help attract customers.  It also means that I don’t necessarily advertise
all of the IP I’ve built on my
<a href="/projects.html">projects page</a>–since
I’m not selling IP but rather my time and abilities.  I prefer not to comment
about the customers I work with, or what their various requirements
are–that’s their business.  I just provide them with a service.</p>

<p>However, a recent project I’ve been working on is worth commenting on from
the standpoint of how to avoid
<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>
in a somewhat unique environment: the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
+ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
environment.  This is probably all the more appropriate, as these
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
+ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
chips are becoming more and more popular.</p>

<p>The project in question was a basic data acquisition system: control <em>N</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">A/D</a>s
running at over a MHz in speed, and spit the results out over Ethernet.
To make this project work, we chose to use the
<a href="http://www.terasic.com/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;No=1046">DE10-Nano</a>
as our processing device, shown below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1. A DE10-Nano board, shown without the A/Ds attached</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/de10-deskpic.jpg" alt="Picture of a DE10-Nano FPGA board from Terasic" width="768" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This also marks my first experience with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
+ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
type device, and what it takes to interface logic with an on-board
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">hard processor</a>, and I
thought I might share with you some of my experiences and the
lessons I learned.</p>

<h2 id="general-project-structure">General Project Structure</h2>

<p>You can see the general structure of the project in Fig 2 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2. Design Structure</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/de10-design.svg" alt="" width="400" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In brief, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM processor</a>
has a number of buses available to it, within the chip, to communicate
over.  I chose the light-weight bus from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
for its simplicity–although I may revisit this decision later.  I then used
<a href="https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-prime/features/qts-platform-designer.html">Qsys</a>
(now called the “<a href="https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-prime/features/qts-platform-designer.html">Platform Designer</a>”
, although few tutorials have been updated since the name change) to
connect my application specific design component(s) to an
<a href="https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/manual/mnl_avalon_spec.pdf">Avalon</a>
memory-mapped I/O bus.</p>

<p>This brings me to my own part of the design.  For this application specific
portion, I bridged from the
<a href="https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/manual/mnl_avalon_spec.pdf">Avalon bus</a>
to a
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone (WB) bus</a>
(all my legacy code was written for
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a>),
and used <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
to assemble my
design components together–assigning addresses and handling the bus
interconnect within my own portion of the design.</p>

<p>This became my
“<a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">debugging bus</a>”
as well for finding bugs within my design.</p>

<p>Further, the
<a href="https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-prime/features/qts-platform-designer.html">Platform Designer</a>
output is a big black box that I needed to create a wrapper for, connecting
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM processor</a>
to the external system components–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">DDR3
SDRAM</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet">GigE</a>
network, etc.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-was-the-process-for-finding-bugs">So what was the process for finding bugs?</h2>

<p>My bug finding approach follows directly from <a href="/blog/2017/06/23/my-dbg-philosophy.html">my basic debugging
philosophy</a>.
However, the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/23/my-dbg-philosophy.html">basic philosophy</a>
really needs to be slightly updated, since I’ve started using
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>.
Basically, I followed the following steps:</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3. Design Process</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/cyclonev-design.svg" alt="Steps in design with Cyclone-V" width="180" /></td></tr></table>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I wrote my design components and immediately “tested” them using the
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
provided by
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys">yosys-smtbmc</a>
and the lint capabilities of
<a href="https://veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>.
If any component didn’t pass muster from both of these tools, I
didn’t even try it on the board.</p>

    <p>This worked well for the bottom or “leaf” nodes of my design tree.</p>

    <p>I also applied this method to a single non-leaf node, one that included my
<a href="/dsp/2017/11/10/delayw.html">delay element</a>
as a sub-component.
The purpose of this module was to segment the data into blocks, and to
calculate the best exponent that could be applied to all of the samples
in a given block.  The timing of this module was critical, but it wasn’t
simple to desk check–so the proof was important.  Indeed, the success
of the entire design depended upon this being done “right”.
However, after cutting the proof down as much as possible, it still
took a rough day of solid CPU computation to finish.  This was rare
among my proofs, as most completed within 5-20 minutes.  Still, I
needed the confidence of that formal verification proof and so I
“paid” that price.</p>

    <p>Neither did I apply
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
to all of the design components.  For example, one component contained
three parallel
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>s closely
integrated together.  Another component contained the
entire signal processing chain (including the parallel
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>s
module).  Neither of these components were
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verified</a>,
although I would’ve loved doing so–I just wasn’t certain I could manage
the complexity required to do so.  Hence these components were
desk-checked,
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">simulated</a>,
and tested on the hardware itself but never
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verified</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the component passed
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal verification</a>
and
<a href="https://veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a> linting, I’d
synthesize it and try it on the board.  If it failed on the board, I’d
add a
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">wishbone scope</a>
to see what was going on.  Since this was an
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> based design, adding or
removing a <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">wishbone
scope</a>
was <em>really</em> easy to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This left me stuck in
<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>
only twice, and never for very long.  First, I was stuck in
<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>
before I learned how to use the golden reference design
properly.  In these cases, the
<a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/product/angstrom-distribution">Angstrom</a>
Linux distribution I was using
would never get past the boot-loader.  Second, I would get stuck in
<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>
any time the system didn’t interact with the
<a href="https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/manual/mnl_avalon_spec.pdf">Avalon bus</a>
properly.</p>

    <p>In the second case, my
<a href="https://veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>-based
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">simulation</a>
rescued me nicely every time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No,  <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">I did not use any Verilog based test-benches</a>.</p>

    <p>After having gotten a taste of
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>,
I’m not sure I’d go back to any
<a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">other approaches</a>
if I didn’t need to.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-crazy-bug">The Crazy Bug</h2>

<p>Ok, so … I did come across a rather “Crazy Bug”.  You know, the kind that
goes down in your memory banks as one that <em>really</em> stands out?  The one bug
in any project that takes you so long to find that you had to take notice
of it?  In my case, this bug took place across the interaction between the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
processor.</p>

<p>For your sake, I’ll share what happened here, lest you get caught in
the same bug yourself.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig. 4. Basic Processing Steps</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/adc-copy-loop.svg" alt="S/w outline" width="180" /></td></tr></table>

<p>After collecting samples from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">A/D</a>s,
those samples went through an initial signal processing chain.
Once that signal processing chain had finished working on the incoming
samples, those samples were placed into a
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>.
When the software running on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
was ready, it would call the
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memcpy/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">memcpy()</code></a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">C-library</a> routine
to copy samples from the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>
to the user’s memory space.  These processed samples were then sent
to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket</a>
to be sent over
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet">GigE</a>
to a part of the system I had no control of.  To make this happen, the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>
was given the largest memory space I could afford, so that a vendor
optimized piece of code (i.e. the
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memcpy/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">memcpy()</code></a>)
could just copy the memory from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig. 5. Memory Copy from FIFO to RAM</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/adc-memcpy.svg" alt="MemCPY" width="400" /></td></tr></table>

<p>I’m sure the actual
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memcpy/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">memcpy()</code></a>)
is a bit more complicated than the logic below, but the following is a basic
pseudocode outline of what the routine does:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="c1">// Example memcpy
</span><span class="kt">void</span>	<span class="nf">memcpy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">ln</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

		<span class="n">ln</span><span class="o">--</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Only … that’s not I the behavior I observed.</p>

<p>Initially, all I knew was that the data coming out of the device was all
jumbled, and I couldn’t tell why.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig. 6. Counter Injection</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/counter-inject.svg" alt="Injecting a counter following the A/Ds" width="240" /></td></tr></table>

<p>If you’ve never had to deal with a data acquisition process like this,
there’s one trick you need to have as part of your bag-of-tricks
to find stream-based processing bugs–the counter.  As shown in Fig 6 on the
right, the counter runs
along side the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">A/D</a>
controller.  It increments with every sample.  A
user-configurable “switch” then selects whether the counter or the data is
sent down-stream.  If done right, you can then check the data values at
the end of your processing stream, and you can tell whether samples
were lost, corrupted, or worse–just by checking whether the ultimate
sample values still had the one-up relationship present with a counter.</p>

<p>It was because this counter was not incrementing by one on every sample
that I knew I had a problem.</p>

<p>So … I applied my
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">scope</a>
to the bus transaction.  My first thought was that I was somehow double
or triple stepping my
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a> on semi-random reads,
so I wanted to see what happened on a read from my
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>.  Using this
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">scope</a>,
I discovered the <a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>
was acting within normal limits.  However, the values
being read didn’t match the values in my code.</p>

<p>Ok, so I adjusted the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">scope</a>
and traced the problem up stream.  Things looked good there.</p>

<p>So I adjusted my <a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>
so that it would return the address pointer instead of
the data.  In this case, the
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memcpy/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">memcpy()</code></a>)’d
buffer came back finally in order with no problems, but the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">scope</a>
finally showed the problem.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/OUT-OF-ORDER.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Instead of reading sample values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
was reading sample values 0, 8, 16, 24, 1, 2, 3, 4, … and then quietly
reordering the samples back into what it thought was the “correct” order.
However, since the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>
based device was producing values in order in spite of the
out of order addresses, when the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
rearranged the reads back in order–the result was the values in the buffer
were now <em>out of order</em>.</p>

<p>Since knowing is half the battle, I now had two choices: I could fix the
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memcpy/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">memcpy()</code></a>)
routine by writing one of my own that didn’t read out of order, or
I could shuffle the memory back into order.  I chose the former and wrote
my own
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memcpy/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">memcpy()</code></a>), one where
I could <em>guarantee</em> that the reads would be issued <em>in order</em>.</p>

<p>This new version of code <em>still</em> read from my
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>
out of order.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM CPU</a>
itself that caused the reads to be
issued out of order, and then quietly placed the memory back in order
on the other end.
However, if I rearranged my own memory copy to never
increment the “fake” address into the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>,
then it finally read it in order.</p>

<p>I’ll say this much: I would’ve never figured this out without my <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">Wishbone
Scope</a>.</p>

<h2 id="immediate-lessons-learned">Immediate Lesson’s Learned</h2>

<p>As with any attempt to use a new piece of technology you aren’t familiar with,
there will be hiccups.  The
<a href="https://www.altera.com/products/fpga/cyclone-series/cyclone-v/overview.html">Cyclone-V</a>
on the
<a href="http://www.terasic.com/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;No=1046">DE10-Nano</a>
was no exception.
Indeed, it took me almost a month of grumbling and confusion to get off the
ground before I discovered that, yes, the
<a href="https://www.terasic.com.tw">Terasic</a>
<a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;CategoryNo=205&amp;No=1046&amp;PartNo=4">documentation</a>
<em>did</em> show me how to interact with this device.  Here are some other
frustrations I came across:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>My first big frustration was <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/de10-nano-board-schematic">the schematic</a> I found online.  It took me some
time to realize that someone had posted a
<a href="http://www.terasic.com/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;No=593">DE0-Nano</a>
schematic on an <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/de10-nano-board-schematic">Intel
DE10-Nano support</a> web-page.</p>

    <p>Sadly, despite posting a comment to this effect, <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/de10-nano-board-schematic">this official
Intel support page</a> <em>still</em> contains a link to the wrong schematic.</p>

    <p>In the end, I needed to destroy and then recreate my project in
<a href="https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-prime/download.html">Quartus</a>
just to convince myself that I had gotten rid of all of the references
to the wrong part.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My next frustration was that I couldn’t find an
<a href="https://www.altera.com">Altera</a> “Libraries” reference.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I’m spoiled: <a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> offers a <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx14_7/7series_hdl.pdf">libraries
guide</a>
that gives you instructions for how to interface with any of the
hard components on the chip.  Hence, if I need a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop">PLL</a>,
I just put a reference to their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop">PLL</a>
within my own code and off I go.</p>

    <p>I couldn’t find a similar libraries guide for
<a href="https://www.altera.com">Altera</a>.  Indeed, I probably
spent much too much time looking for it.</p>

    <p>In the end, I just swallowed my aversion to working with GUI’s and built the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop">PLL</a>
I needed using <a href="https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-prime/features/qts-platform-designer.html">Platform
Designer</a>.
Since resigning to use <a href="https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-prime/features/qts-platform-designer.html">Platform
Designer</a>,
it has handled all of my needs to date–I just hate using GUI’s: they are
slow, and they can hide details where I’m not looking for them, etc.
Although, looking over the <a href="https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-prime/features/qts-platform-designer.html">Platform
Designer</a>
generated data file in the end, it’s <em>just an XML file</em>–one that submits
nicely to “diff”, and thus one I can use with
<a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>
quite nicely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My second problem had to deal with the “Golden H/W design”
<a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;CategoryNo=205&amp;No=1046&amp;PartNo=4">provided by</a>
<a href="https://www.terasic.com.tw">Terasic</a> for the board.</p>

    <p>Looking through this design with Altera’s <a href="https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-prime/features/qts-platform-designer.html">Platform
Designer</a>,
I could easily identify a variety of things I didn’t need.  I dumped these
out of my project, and then cleaned up the result so that there were
only the components I needed, and then built the project.</p>

    <p>It didn’t work.  The board would load and run the bootloader just fine.
The bootloader would load my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
design, but would then fail to start Linux.  Not knowing how to debug Linux
loading to know what device was failing, how, or why, I just couldn’t
tell why not.</p>

    <p>In the end, I went back and rebuilt the Golden Design
<a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;CategoryNo=205&amp;No=1046&amp;PartNo=4">as provided</a>,
and then only modified it for my application.  This worked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I really dislike vendor code that doesn’t match my own high quality coding
standards.</p>

    <p>By this I mean two things.  First, I use <code class="highlighter-rouge">default_nettype none</code> in all of
my designs.  It helps me avoid a whole variety of painful Verilog bugs.
However, a bug in the <a href="https://www.altera.com">Altera</a>’s
<a href="https://www.altera.com/products/fpga/cyclone-series/cyclone-v/overview.html">Cyclone-V</a>
IP would cause my design to fail if I tried to use this across my design.</p>

    <p>With a little bit of help from an <a href="http://www.clifford.at">amazing mentor</a>,
I managed to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">default_nettype none</code> at the top of my files, and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">default_nettype wire</code> at the bottom and
<a href="https://www.altera.com">Altera</a>’s
broken code would still synthesize.</p>

    <p>I then got all kinds of warnings from their “working” IP.  I mean, really
guys, can’t you clean up <em>your own</em> IP?  How can I tell if my
implementation of your IP has problems if your IP fills the logs with
warnings–<em>when it works</em>!?  (Incidentally,
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a>’s code isn’t any
better, and <a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a>’s MIG-generated
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">DDR3 SDRAM</a>
controller is a particular offender …)</p>

    <p>The worst of these warnings said that I hadn’t mapped several pins
properly, and yet the pin mapping tool wouldn’t let me do anything with
these hardware-assigned yet somehow mis-mapped pins.  As with the
other warnings, these could be ignored, but how was I to know that when
things weren’t working?</p>

    <p>Again, building the <a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;CategoryNo=205&amp;No=1046&amp;PartNo=4">Golden H/W Reference Design</a>
gave me some
confidence, as I could then see that I still got the same warnings
and yet for some outrageous reason, the
<a href="http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;CategoryNo=205&amp;No=1046&amp;PartNo=4">Golden Design</a>
worked in spite of the warnings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This blog is about debugging
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>s,
though, so what did I learn from that standpoint?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>One mistake in the
<a href="https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/manual/mnl_avalon_spec.pdf">Avalon bus</a>
controller would lock up the device <em>HARD</em>.</p>

    <p>If this happened, the only solution appeared to be pulling power.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal</a> proof
of the
<a href="https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/manual/mnl_avalon_spec.pdf">Avalon</a>
to <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a>
converter created a bit of a false confidence for me: my design
still locked up at times.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The first problem I had with my
<a href="https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/manual/mnl_avalon_spec.pdf">Avalon</a>
bus interface
was that I somehow managed to <em>assume</em> within my
proof that all transactions would be read transactions.  The assumption
wasn’t simple, and it wasn’t obvious, so I never realized what happened
from a simple desk check.</p>

        <p>In the end, I figured out what was going on via
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">simulation</a>.</p>

        <p>When I went back to the
formal properties, I realized I hadn’t created
any “cover” properties, and that a simple “cover” property or two
would’ve revealed this problem.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>My next problem was when I mis-wired a bus component in
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.</p>

        <p>For a given peripheral, the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB strobe</a>
value is given by the overall
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">wishbone strobe (a
transaction request)</a>
<a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">logically <code class="highlighter-rouge">AND</code>ed
with the peripheral’s address select line</a>.  I had forgotten this
address select line logical <code class="highlighter-rouge">AND</code> on one component, and so that
component was responding to <em>EVERY</em> transaction across the bus–with
pretty catastrophic results.</p>

        <p>As with the prior problem, I found this pretty quickly … once I fired
up the <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">simulator</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Simulator</a>?
How …?</p>

    <p>Yes.  Exactly.  I couldn’t simulate the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a> processor, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM">DDR3 SDRAM</a>,
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet">GigE</a>
network, the lightweight
<a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI</a> bridge,
or the
<a href="http://www.gstitt.ece.ufl.edu/courses/fall15/eel4720_5721/labs/refs/AXI4_specification.pdf">AXI</a> to
<a href="https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/manual/mnl_avalon_spec.pdf">Avalon</a>
memory-mapped I/O bridge, but I could create a
<a href="https://veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>-based
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">simulation</a>
of the
<a href="https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/manual/mnl_avalon_spec.pdf">Avalon</a>
bus interface on down–to include simulating
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">A/D</a>s.
That portion of the design was a fairly straight-forward
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
based implementation, and even though it wasn’t a full-design
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">simulation</a>,
it was enough to
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">simulate</a>
enough of the design to find many problems.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given my experiences with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
+ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
architecture, would I recommend it for others?  As with any engineering
decision, your choice will depend upon the requirements of your problem.
However, I would have <em>really</em> struggled if this had been my first-ever
design.  Hence, I’d recommend beginners start with something simpler–such
as a plain
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
with an on-board (debuggable)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_microprocessor">soft-core CPU</a>,
before adding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>
to the mix.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>There’s more I could say, but this post is long enough as is.  I’d like to be
able to blog some more about the
<a href="https://www.altera.com/content/dam/altera-www/global/en_US/pdfs/literature/manual/mnl_avalon_spec.pdf">Avalon</a>
to <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">WB</a>
bridge and how I managed to formally verify it,
how easy it is to suddenly add a
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">scope</a>
to a design using
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>,
or indeed how powerful
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>
is in general.</p>

<p>These discussions will sadly need to wait for a later day.</p>
