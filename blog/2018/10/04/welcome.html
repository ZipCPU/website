    <p>If you are new here, I’d like to take this personal opportunity to welcome you
to the <a href="https://zipcpu.com/">ZipCPU blog</a>!</p>

<p>I discuss FPGA design methodology, completed designs,
<a href="/dsp/dsp.html">DSP</a>, <a href="/formal/formal.html">formal
methods</a>, and more.  I’ve also been known
to <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ZipCPU">tweet</a> about the same as well.  If you
aren’t <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ZipCPU">following me on twitter</a>, then let me
invite you to do so–or you’ll miss the weekly formal verification quizzes.
The blog also has an <a href="/feed.xml">RSS feed</a>, and
you are welcome to subscribe to it, although I have been known to wait some
time after posting before updating the <a href="/feed.xml">RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a beginner, the blog is loosely built so that the simpler topics
are the older ones that you’ll find at the bottom of the page.  I would
therefore recommend you start reading the blog from the oldest articles to
the newest.  If you do so, you’ll also notice my methods have changed somewhat
as well–I didn’t use <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a>
at first.  Perhaps one day I’ll organize all of my posts into a textbook.
Such a textbook would be built around the premise that design engineers
spend the most of their time debugging, and so it would focus on not only
learning designs, but
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>,
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>,
and <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">troubleshooting as
well</a>.
As such, it would have the three thrusts of learning shown below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1. Tentative Digital Design Learning Outline</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/course-outline.svg" alt="" width="760" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Until that time, these posts will remain organized by date only, somewhat
disorganized by ability level, and topically disorganized.  While I have tried
to sort the <a href="/topics.html">site by topic here</a>, I’ve also
discovered in the process that the major categories overlap, so
<a href="/topics.html">that page</a> has only been somewhat successful.</p>

<p>I also teach a two-day on-site course in
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal verification</a>
using a commercial version
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>
with support for VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog, and the full SystemVerilog
assertion language.  That course is more organized than these blog articles
are.  If you are interested,
<a href="https://www.symbioticeda.com">SymbioticEDA</a>
handles the scheduling on my behalf.</p>

<p>While I enjoy and welcome discussion, there is <a href="/blog/2017/08/01/advertising.html">no discussion
capability</a> on <a href="https://zipcpu.com/">this
blog</a>, and some topics just don’t fit
in <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ZipCPU">tweets</a>.  (Sorry.)  Depending upon the
type of discussion you would like, feel free to either ask on
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net">freenode</a>’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#yosys</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">##FPGA</code> channels (you will need to get a free account) where I am
known as ZipCPU, or alternatively on <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> where I
try to monitor both the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA">FPGA</a> and the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yosys">yosys</a> channels as well.
If you ask a yosys question that is too difficult for me on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yosys">reddit</a>, I’ve been known to bring it up to
Clifford at our weekly meetings, and answer it then.  For such questions,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yosys">reddit replies</a> can take a couple of days.</p>

<p>You should also know that I am a Christian, and I am not ashamed of it.  My own
life has been dedicated to the service of Christ, and that now includes this
blog.  You can expect occasional articles on
<a href="/blog/2017/08/12/caused-to-lie.html">ethics</a>,
morality,
and <a href="/blog/2018/04/01/resurrection-day.html">Christianity</a>,
verses at the end of each post, and even
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/ZipCPU">tweets</a> on such topics from time to time.</p>

<p>My Christian beliefs are centered around a literal interpretation of the Bible.
This includes a belief in a <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/exo/20/11">6-day
creation</a>
that took place roughly six-thousand years ago, a belief that God will
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2pe/3/7">cause the end of this world</a>
rather than any man-induced climate change, a firm belief that a <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/22/36">free people
should be an armed people</a>,
and more.</p>

<p>These beliefs have also led me to very strong right-wing political views.</p>

<p>My point is simply this: if these things will offend you, and they have
offended some, then consider this as your fair warning.</p>

<p>If you are still interested in the <a href="https://zipcpu.com/">ZipCPU
blog</a>, and even more if you find it valuable,
then please consider supporting it.  The <a href="https://zipcpu.com/">ZipCPU
blog</a> is supported entirely through
donations made by folks such as you, as well as my own love of helping and
encouraging others.  If you have benefited from the blog, then let me invite
you to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">contribute a small sum on a monthly
basis</a>.  Should you do so, you’ll also have
access to another discussion forum on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">Patreon</a>,
where I write occasional messages to my sponsors, ask them about what topics
might interest them and so on.  I also have some designs, such as a WB to
AXI-lite bridge, an AXI-lite to WB bridge, together with an AXI-lite formal
property file, which are available to sponsors only.  Using this formal
property file, it’s easy to show how and why Xilinx’s example AXI peripheral
code is broken.</p>

<p>Either way, welcome, and I hope to have had the opportunity to encourage you
in your own journey while you are here.</p>
