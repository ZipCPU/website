    <p>When I first started working with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>s on my
own, the board I started with was a
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users">Basys3</a>
board.
As a new student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> design, and particularly one on a budget, I wanted to create a series of
designs that would eventually use all of the hardware ports of that board.
You know, get the most for your money?  Hence the question, how best should I
use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a> port?</p>

<p>My original thought was to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a>
port was to create a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">screen buffer</a>, and then
to display that buffer.  The only problem was that a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">screen buffer</a>
big enough to hold a <code class="highlighter-rouge">640*480</code> screen requires 307kB of buffer space, and the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users">Basys3</a>
board didn’t have any external RAM memory, and the Artix-735T
sold on the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users">Basys3</a>
board didn’t have enough block RAM for such a buffer.</p>

<p>How to solve this?</p>

<p>Eventually, I settled on an approach that used a 25MHz pixel clock and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">flash memory</a>.  Of course, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">flash memory</a>
wasn’t fast enough to drive the 25MHz
pixel clock, so I instead run-length encoded the image data and dropped the
bits per pixel down to a four bit value that could then used in a color table
lookup to get full 12’bit color which was all that the
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users">Basys3</a>
board supported.</p>

<p>If you’ve worked with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>s
for a while, you’ll quickly recognize that every step in this increasingly
complex processing chain is an opportunity for things to break.  The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">flash</a> controller
needs to work perfectly, the memory reader that feeds the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/29/fifo.html">FIFO</a>
needs to work perfectly, and then the decoder needs to work perfectly.
One missed pixel and the entire decompression chain will produce a garbage
output for the rest of the frame.</p>

<p>Oh, and did I mention the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
was also trying to use the memory on this little board at the same time?</p>

<p>The traditional way I’ve seen others decode things like this in the past is to
use some form of scope applied to the horizontal and vertical sync’s of the
video image.  This would confirm that the video sync signals were being
properly sent to the screen.  The problem with this approach is that you’ll
never have enough fingers to get a trace from all of the video wires and,
worse, even if you did you’d struggle to decipher the traces without any other
context.</p>

<p>As I’m sure you can imagine, this approach didn’t work for me.</p>

<p>The reason it didn’t work is that the image might decode nicely for half the
screen, and then somehow get off cut and then it would degrade into
decompressed chaos.  Well, that and I didn’t own an oscilloscope until much
later.</p>

<p>Instead, I chose a different approach:
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
based video simulation.  Using a video simulator, I could slow things down and
even stop the simulation anytime something “wrong” showed up on the screen and
go back and debug whatever the problem was.</p>

<p>Today, let’s talk about how <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">the simulator
works</a>, and then walk through a
demonstration design that will draw some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_card">color bars</a>
onto a simulated video screen.</p>

<h2 id="the-vga-simulator">The VGA Simulator</h2>

<p>If you’ve never tried <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">this VGA simulator</a>
before, you can <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">find it on
github</a>, separated into its own repository.
The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">simulator</a> depends upon the gtkmm-3.0
library, and so on the libgtkmm-3.0-dev Ubuntu package.  (It might even run
on Windows under <a href="/blog/2017/07/28/cygwin-fpga.html">Cygwin</a>,
I just haven’t tried it.)  If you have both
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
and this library installed, you should be able to run the demo by typing:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">% </span>git clone https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim
<span class="gp">% </span><span class="nb">cd </span>vgasim
<span class="gp">% </span>make
<span class="gp">% </span><span class="nb">cd </span>bench/cpp
<span class="gp">% </span>./main_tb -g 640x480</code></pre></figure>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1. VGA Simulation Test Color Bars</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/llvga-testimg.png"><img src="/img/llvga-testimg.png" alt="" width="320" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>If all goes well, you should see the image at the right within a window on your
screen.  You can kill the program by either typing control-C in your bash
window, or by clicking on the close box of the window it creates.</p>

<p>Let’s examine this image for a moment.</p>

<p>First, the image in Figure 1 very carefully has a white box around the border
of the image.  This box denotes the first and last pixel of every line,
as well as the first and last line of every frame.  It’s an important test for
this reason first: it shows if you’ve lost any pixels due to timing, as these
will otherwise fall off the screen.</p>

<p>Second, the image explores the color space of your video output.  Notice the
many shades of red, green, blue, and gray at the bottom of the image.</p>

<p>Third, but perhaps not so obvious, no image would be possible without creating
a proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a> signal.  This means
that behind the scenes, there needed to be horizontal and vertical sync channels
as well as three serial streams of data that all had to line up properly
together.</p>

<p>Finally, it just <em>looks</em> like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_card">old fashioned TV test
image</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 2. Framebuffer Demo</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/llvga-fulldemo.png"><img src="/img/llvga-fulldemo.png" alt="" width="320" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>If this isn’t enough to get your interest, then let me offer some other
capabilities found within the repository.  First, if you have the screen space
to run the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">simulator</a> with a sub-window of
1280x1024 (<code class="highlighter-rouge">main_tb</code> with no arguments), you can see the results of a more
typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">frame buffer</a>
implementation, shown (shrunken) in Fig. 2 on the left.</p>

<p>The third demonstration within the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA
simulation</a> repository is that of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a> input
simulator, such as might come from a camera.  This simulation is built as the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">simcheck</code> executable within the same <code class="highlighter-rouge">bench/cpp</code> directory.  To run it,
simply type:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="gp">% </span>simcheck</code></pre></figure>

<p>As before, you can kill this simulation by either Ctrl-C or clicking the close
button on the window.</p>

<p>What does this input/camera simulator do?  It creates a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a> inputs to a design.  It
creates these inputs from a input image obtained from the top left corner
of your screen.  You can then process that input within your
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilated</a>
Verilog design to your hearts content.
Alternatively, you can send the inputs from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a> input simulator directly
into the regular <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA simulator</a> to
see it on the screen.</p>

<p>What’s really fun about this camera simulator is when you overlap the output
window with the camera “input” area, you can get some really neat effects,
such as are shown in Fig 3. below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3. The output from the VGA input simulator fed directly into the simulation window</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/llvga-camsim.png"><img src="/img/llvga-camsim.png" alt="" width="780" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>In this image, the window at the top left is the same
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA simulation</a> output display program
shown in Fig. 1.  What’s different is the second window just to the right and
below it.  This is the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA simulation</a>
output that just reflects the source information to the simulated output.
The third “window” showing further to the right is the recursive effect
I was just mentioning.  In reality, there’s no “window” there, but just a
recreation of the top left 640x480 pixels of the image.</p>

<p>Shall we dig into the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">simulator</a> a bit
and see how to use it?</p>

<h2 id="the-wiring">The Wiring</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA simulator</a> is based around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a> signaling standard.  Yes, I know this
is an older standard, but it’s also an easy one to learn from.  I do have an
HDMI simulator lying around that is very likely to eventually join this
repository …</p>

<p>But back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a> standard consists of five signals.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">o_vga_vsync</code>, the Vertical sync (pronounced “sink”), 1’bit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">o_vga_hsync</code>, the Horizontal sync (pronounced “sink”), 1’bit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">o_vga_red</code>, Red pixel component, up to 8’bits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">o_vga_grn</code>, Green, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">o_vga_blu</code>, Blue, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The simulator accepts any color depth up to 8-bits per pixel.  Anything over 8-bits,
and it just pays attention to the top 8-bits.</p>

<p>To use the simulator with your design, you need to build a
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/bench/cpp/main_tb.cpp">test-bench wrapper</a> around the design, tell the test bench what resolution
you want the window to have, and then call the video subsystem to pay attention
to video events while running your design.</p>

<p>Then, within the <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">tick()</code> method of this test

the simulator is called with the output values from your
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a> core:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++">	<span class="kt">void</span>	<span class="nf">tick</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

	<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s how you hook up your design, but what do those various signals
carry?</p>

<p>Let’s consider the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_vga_hsync</code>, or horizontal sync, signal first.  In an old
fashioned cathode ray-tube monitor, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a> signal would tell the underlying
ray subsystem when to quickly move back from the right side to the left side
of the screen.</p>

<p>The signal itself is an active low signal, as shown in Fig. 4 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4. The Horizontal Synch Signal</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/llvga-hsync.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The signal should be high at all times except during the Horizontal Synch
pulse, where it is low.  Between the sync pulse and the data is the “back
porch”, and then again on the other side between the data and the sync is
a “front porch”.  While these may seem to be just idle clock periods, they
are actually carefully timed and required by the video subsystem.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">The simulator</a> needs to be told what these
time periods are.  This is done within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/bench/cpp/videomode.h">videomode.h</a>
file, a portion of which is shown below:</p>

<p>Here you’ll see that, internal to the simple WIDTHxHEIGHT video mode call,
horizontal and vertical video mode lines are set according to the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86_Modeline">XFree86
modeline</a> “standard”,
as illustrated in Fig. 5 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 5. The four numbers within a mode line</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/llvga-counter.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The first number is the number of valid pixels in the line, it counts from the
left to the width of the line.  Don’t be confused by Fig. 5 trying to show
the relationship of the sync line to the valid pixel data, the sync line
is high during this period.  The second number includes the additional
width of the front porch, but remains measured from the left edge.  The
third number adds the width of the sync, while the fourth number
is the total number of pixel clock intervals before the pattern repeats.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 6. A basic video image, showing both horizontal and vertical sync regions</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/llvga-twin-syncs.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The vertical sync mode is similar.  It also consists of the same intervals:
valid pixel (line) data, back porch, sync, and front porch.
The big difference is that instead of counting pixel clocks, the vertical mode
line counts horizontal lines.  Further, these horizontal lines are counted
from the beginning of the horizontal sync interval.  This yields to the
apparent discontinuity shown in Fig 6. on the right.  This discontinuity only
exists, however, because we’ve chosen to place the image at the top-left
of our coordinate system.  Had we started at the beginning of the horizontal
and video sync joint intervals, there would be no apparent discontinuity.</p>

<p>Fig. 6 should also give you a good idea of how to start building a basic video
system: with horizontal and vertical position counters.  Let’s try that,
and see how far we can get!</p>

<h2 id="the-concept">The Concept</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/bench/rtl/design.v">demonstration
design</a>
within this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA
simulation repository</a> consists of
a couple basic components, as shown in Fig. 7.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 7. Demonstration Video Design Components</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/llvga-demofiles.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Let’s quickly walk through the pieces of this design, and then spend some
time digging into the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/llvga.v">llvga.v</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">vgatestsrc.v</a>
components.</p>

<p>The overall design consists of both a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/bench/rtl/memdev.v">memory
device</a>
and a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/wbvgaframe.v">video frame
controller</a>.
We’ve <a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">discussed this memory device
before</a>, so we need not
discuss it again here.  The
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">memory</a>
is controlled by a
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">wishbone</a>
<a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-wb-master.html">master</a>
and video controller,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/wbvgaframe.v">wbvgaframe.v</a>.
Within this controller, there’s
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/imgfifo.v">a component</a>
to read frame-data from the memory using the memory/bus clock,
and then to cross clocks via an
<a href="/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html">asynchronous FIFO</a>
to the pixel clock domain.  Once in the pixel clock domain, pixels
are then fed to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/llvga.v">low level VGA signal
generator</a>.
Internal to this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/llvga.v">lower level VGA signal
generator</a>
is the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">test-source
generator</a>
that produced the image shown in Fig 1 above.</p>

<p>While we’ve discussed many of these components on the blog before,
such as the
<a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">memory</a>, the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">wishbone bus</a>,
and the
<a href="/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html">asynchronous FIFO</a>,
there are several components of this design that we haven’t discussed before.
Today, let’s examine the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/llvga.v">lower-level VGA
generator</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">test-bar signal
generator</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 8: Lower Level VGA Controller Ports</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/llvga-ports.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/llvga.v">lower-level VGA signal
generator</a>
is designed to interact with the pixel generation subsystem
(<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/wbvgaframe.v">wbvgaframe.v</a>),
and to produce the necessary video signal outputs in order to generate the
images above.  Here you can see in Fig. 8 the ports necessary to do this.
We’ve already discussed the ports on the right above, albeit under slightly
different names.  The new ports are those on the left.  While the reset
port might be obvious, the others might need a bit more explaining.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">i_pixclk</code>  I normally name all my incoming clock signals <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_clk</code>.  This
has become habit forming to me.  Not so with this module.  In the case
of many video signals, the pixel clock runs at a different rate from the
main system clock.  Hence, I’ve reserved <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_clk</code> for other parts of my
design.  This component acts upon the pixel clock, <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_pixclk</code>, alone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">i_test</code> is a flag that I use to tell the controller to produce the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_card">test bars output</a>
I demonstrated in Fig 1. above.  If <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_test</code> is not set, the controller
will source its pixels externally from <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_rgb_pix</code>, otherwise it will
source the pixels from the internal <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">VGA test source
generator</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">o_rd</code> is the first of three pipeline control signals used to help the
pixel generator, either
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/imgfifo.v">imgfifo.v</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">vgatestsrc.v</a>
in this design, know when to generate to pixels.
It functions very much like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">!stall</code> signal in the “simple
handshake” <a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">pipeline strategy we presented
earlier</a>.</p>

    <p>Only, this signal is a little trickier than a negated stall signal.  The
pixel generator is expected to set up a pipeline filled with pixels
and then wait for this signal to go high.  Once this signal goes high,
pixel data will flow.  The pixel generator needs to be careful to <em>never</em>
let the pixel feed buffer empty, or catestrophic things may happen.
(i.e., the display won’t show the image we want)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newline</code> signal is used to indicate that the last pixel in the
row has been consumed, and the pixel generator is free to flush any
line buffers and start over if it wishes to.</p>

    <p>In this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/bench/rtl/demo.v">demonstration
design</a>,
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newline</code> signal is only used by the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">test image
generator</a>.
We’ll look at that further down.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last pipeline indication signal is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newframe</code> signal.  This
signal is very much like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newline</code> signal, save that it indicates the
end of the frame as well as the end of the line.  This signal is to be
true on the last pixel of the frame, and then only.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/imgfifo.v">demonstration frame
buffer</a>
uses this signal to flush its buffers and start reading from the top of the
image.</p>

    <p>In the old arcade days, this signal might create a “vertical refresh”
interrupt to signal the start of the vertical refresh period.  This
was a time when screen memory was not being read and so software
could quickly draw to the screen in a way that wouldn’t flicker.
Such “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_(screen)#Software_artifacts">Flickering</a>”
can be caused by a software update to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">frame
buffer</a>, typically consisting
of both an erase operation and a redraw, taking place during the active
portion of the image, so that the user sees alternately the “erased”
portion and the newly drawn portion.  This can be fixed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering#Double_buffering_in_computer_graphics">double
buffering</a>,
so that the partially drawn image never ends up in the
live <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">frame buffer</a>.
Doing so requires knowing when to swap buffers, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newframe</code>
signal will facilitate that request.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/llvga.v">lower-level VGA
generator</a> may be
the simplest component of the entire display system:  <em>It’s just a pair of
counters!</em>  So, let’s see how much this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/llvga.v">low-level VGA
controller</a>
can accomplish from two separate counters.</p>

<p>First, let’s accept as inputs all of the various components of the two
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86_Modeline">video mode lines</a>.
These are simply passed through from the top-level

<p>as inputs to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/bench/rtl/demo.v">top level

<p>While we are going to allow these values to be practically anything within
this <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/llvga.v">lower level
controller</a>,
they do require a particular order between them.  Specifically, they need
to be strictly increasing,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">i_hm_width  &lt; i_hm_porch &lt; i_hm_synch &lt; i_hm_raw, and

<p>and there is a minimum width and height.  When we get to
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal verification</a>,
we can use the following assumption to capture this required ordering.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>This will force the width to be at least ten pixels wide, likewise for
vertical.  The other three numbers of each mode line are also required
to be in strict increasing order.</p>

<p>This allows us to create a simple counter to keep track of our horizontal
position.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">hpos</span>       <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span>

<p>A similar counter can be used to keep track of our vertical position.</p>

<p>Well, it’s not quite that simple.  We also need to generate the horizontal
sync signal as well as our pipeline control signals.  The obvious signal
we could set within this same loop is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newline</code> signal.  As discussed
above, this signal is true for one-clock only at the very last pixel of any
line.</p>

<p>The next item to create in this block is a little less obvious.  This is the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">hrd</code> signal.  We’ll use this in a bit to indicate a valid pixel, but we’ll
need to couple it with a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">vrd</code> signal from the vertical direction first.</p>

<p>Put together, this expands our logic a bit more, but it’s still fundamentally
a counter–we just set two other signals within this block as well.</p>

<p>Can you still see the basic <code class="highlighter-rouge">hpos</code> counter within there?</p>

<p>Fig. 9 below shows a trace of this simple logic, focused at the end of the line.
For this trace, the line width was set to 640 pixels, hence <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newline</code>
is true on pixel <code class="highlighter-rouge">639</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_rd</code> drops on the first non-pixel: <code class="highlighter-rouge">640</code>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 9: End-of-line logic trace</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/llvga-hpostrace1.png"><img src="/img/llvga-hpostrace1.png" alt="" width="954" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>In a similar fashion, Fig. 10 below shows the same trace, but zoomed out far
enough so that you can see a full between-line interval.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 10: Horizontal Sync trace</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/llvga-hpostrace2.png"><img src="/img/llvga-hpostrace2.png" alt="" width="956" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>During this interval,
you may notice that our valid pixel signal, <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_rd</code>, goes low before the
horizontal sync becomes active (low), and stays low for some period after
the sync becomes inactive again but before the valid pixels start up again.</p>

<p>The vertical counter is similar.  The biggest difference is that the
vertical counter changes at the end of the horizontal front porch, just as
the horizontal sync signal becomes active.</p>

<p>Perhaps you noticed that we didn’t set <code class="highlighter-rouge">vrd</code> above.  Since this signal is
so simple, it can quietly fit into its own block.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">vrd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="o">;</span>

<p>Now, <code class="highlighter-rouge">vrd &amp;&amp; hrd</code> will always be true one clock before a valid pixel, as marked
by <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_rd</code>.  We’ll call this pre-signal <code class="highlighter-rouge">w_rd</code>, to indicate that we are using
combinatorial logic (i.e. a wire) for this purpose.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="kt">wire</span>	<span class="n">w_rd</span><span class="o">;</span>

<p>We’ll except the very <code class="highlighter-rouge">first frame</code> from this calculation, just to make
certain we’ve given the pixel generator a chance to see the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newframe</code>
signal before starting.  Creating the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_rd</code> signal is then just as simple
as registering this <code class="highlighter-rouge">w_rd</code> signal on the next pixel clock.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">o_rd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">;</span>

<p>In a fashion similar to our <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newline</code> signal, we’ll create an
<code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newframe</code> signal in case our pixel generation logic needs to do some
work to prepare for the next frame.</p>

<p>You can see these vertical signals together with our horizontal signals in
Fig. 11 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 11: Vertical Sync trace</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/llvga-vpostrace1.png"><img src="/img/llvga-vpostrace1.png" alt="" width="954" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>Notice that <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newframe</code> will only ever be true when <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newline</code> is also
true: both are true on the last pixel of a line.  The difference, of course,
is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newframe</code> is only true on the last pixel of the last line.
We’ll use this property later to
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally constrain</a>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newline</code>.</p>

<p>Likewise, Fig 12 shows the same trace, but only zoomed out so that we can
see many lines at once.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 12: Vertical Sync trace, showing many lines</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/llvga-vpostrace2.png"><img src="/img/llvga-vpostrace2.png" alt="" width="956" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>Not only can we see many lines at once, but Fig 12 also shows a full vertical
blanking interval, including the front porch, sync, and back porch.  You can
recognize these by noticing the relationship of <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_vsync</code> to the valid data
marked by <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_rd</code>.  You can also see where the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newframe</code> signal is placed
relative to the rest of the intervals: right at the last pixel of the entire
frame.</p>

<p>If you’ve never dealt with video before, it really is just this simple: the
synchronization portion is nothing more than a pair of counters!  We’ve
added additional signals to indicate when line endings and frame endings
take place, but that’s really all there is to it.</p>

<p>Since this is just that simple, verifying this component is also very simple.
Let’s discuss that next.</p>

<h2 id="formally-verifying-our-counters">Formally Verifying our Counters</h2>

<p>When I
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verify</a>
a module, I like to think of that module in terms
of a “contract”.  This “contract” is sort of a black box description of
what I expect from the module.  In many ways the study of
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verification</a>
then becomes the study of how to answer the question, “what sort of <em>contract</em>
is appropriate for what I’m building”?</p>

<p>In this case, I’d first want to verify that I am creating the synchronization
signals as required.</p>

<p>We can start with the horizontal sync.  Before the end of the front porch,
the sync should be inactive (high).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_pixclk</span><span class="p">)</span>

			<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_hsync</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then between the end of the front porch and the end of the synchronization
section, the horizontal sync should be active (low).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hpos</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">i_hm_synch</span><span class="p">)</span>
			<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">o_hsync</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, between the end of the synchronization period and the end of the
line period, the synchronization should be inactive (high).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">else</span>
			<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_hsync</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This exact same logic applies to the vertical synchronization period as well.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="c1">// Same thing for vertical

<p>Wow, how simple could that be?</p>

<p>Have we fully constrained our video controller?  Not quite.</p>

<p>We still need to make certain that the horizontal position is properly
incrementing.  (But the code says it is …)  For this, let’s just check the
past value and contrain the current one based upon that.  If the past value
is at or beyond the last pixel of the line, then we should be starting on
a new line on this clock.  Otherwise, we should be incrementing our horizontal
pointer.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">($</span><span class="nb">past</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hpos</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">i_hm_raw</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">))</span>

<p>The vertical counter is similar, save that it only increments at the beginning
edge of the horizontal sync period, otherwise it should be the same in all
cases.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hpos</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">i_hm_porch</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>These two constraints, however, aren’t enough to keep the two counters within
their limits.  To do that, we need to insist that they are less than the
proper raw widths.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hpos</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">i_hm_raw</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span>

<p>Without these last two assertions, the
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal</a>
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction step</a>
might start our design way out of bounds.  Indeed, you should always
assert that any state variables are within bounds!  That’s the purpose of
these last two assertions.</p>

<p>At this point, we’ve created enough assertions to guarantee that a monitor
capable of synchronizing to this signal will do so.</p>

<p>Everything else is icing on the cake.</p>

<p>We first have our <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_rd</code> value which will signal to the part of the design
that sends us pixels that we just accepted a pixel.  This value should be
true during any valid pixel period.  We can check this simply with,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">hpos</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">i_hm_width</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">vpos</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">i_vm_height</span><span class="p">)</span>

			<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_rd</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="k">else</span>
			<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">o_rd</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That leaves two other signals: the newline signal and the new frame
signal.  The newline signal is true on the last clock period of any line.
We can assert that here.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hpos</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">i_hm_width</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">)</span>

			<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">o_newline</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newframe</code> signal needs to be true at the same time as
<code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newline</code>, but only on the last valid line.  Otherwise this should be zero.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">vpos</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">i_vm_height</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_newline</span><span class="p">))</span>
			<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_newframe</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span>
		<span class="k">else</span>
			<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">o_newframe</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There is one catch in all of this simplicity: our assertions above will
fail if the video mode is changed.  This I found annoying, since I had
written the code above to be self correcting upon any mode changes, yet I
struggled to find a way to
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verify</a>
this code as self correcting–the
solver just kept changing the mode line every chance it could.  As a
compromise, I only check the above properties if the video frame is
stable.  To do that, I capture the video mode for the last clock, both
horizontal and vertical mode signals,</p>

<p>I know these are stable when their values are the same as they were one clock
ago.</p>

<p>While I could assume that the mode was always stable, I would like to make
this design able to change modes.  (The simulator cannot change modes, but
this portion of the design can.)  For this, I just insist that the modes
are identical unless the reset line is high.</p>

<p>I can also hear some of you asking, why did I create <code class="highlighter-rouge">f_last_hmode</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">f_last_vmode</code>?  Why not just use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$past()</code> operator?  Even better, the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">$stable()</code> operator, short hand for <code class="highlighter-rouge">X == $past(X)</code>, would perfectly describe
our situation.  Why not just say instead,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>The answer is subtle, and reveals a bit about how
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a> works.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">$past(X)</code> operator, though, requires
a clock.  Because of that, it isn’t evaluated until the next clock edge.
(This is why assertion failures for clocked blocks appear at the penultimate
clock edge.)</p>

<p>Where this becomes a problem is when the design fails at the final clock
edge, because the assumption hasn’t taken effect yet.  By creating our own
version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">$stable()</code> above using <code class="highlighter-rouge">f_last_hmode</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">f_last_vmode</code>, we can
force the mode to be stable on the last cycle–even before the rising edge
would evaluate a <code class="highlighter-rouge">$stable(X)</code> operator.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 13: Calculating a best color</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/llvga-srcmux.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Let’s now turn our attention to creating the test pattern.  This
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">generator</a>
works by calculating a color for each line, and then selecting the right
color from among all of the line colors as shown in Fig. 13 on the right.</p>

<p>Well, not quite.  Selecting from among 480+ line colors might be more logic
than I’d want to use for a simple <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">test pattern
generator</a>.
Here’s the secret: colors are generated in bands.</p>

<p>What may not be obvious is that the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">test pattern
generator</a>
segments the
screen into 16x16 sections.  Determining what color to generate is mostly
just a matter of determining which 16x16 location the current pixel is within.
Note that these may not have been the proportions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_card">original test
cards</a>
from which these images are (loosely) drawn–but they make the math easy for us
and so we use them here.</p>

<p>Calculating the section at issue comes back to the same issue of counters
again.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">test pattern
generator</a>
uses one counter for horizontal position, and another for vertical–just like
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/llvga.v">low-level
controller</a>
we just examined above.</p>

<p>Let’s start by following the horizontal counter, <code class="highlighter-rouge">hpos</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_pixclk</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>On every new line, this counter resets to zero.  Further, on every valid
pixel, the counter moves forward.  There’s no checking whether or not the
counter has reached the full width, since that is done via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_newline</code>
flag.</p>

<p>What may be curious, though, are the two values <code class="highlighter-rouge">hbar</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">hedge</code>.
These variables are associated with dividing the screen into sixteen horizontal
regions.  Specifically, the idea is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">hbar</code> is the current horizontal pixel
location times 16 and divided by the width.</p>

<p>The problem is division within an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> is hard.  How can it be avoided?</p>

<p>The first step towards avoiding this is to divide the width by sixteen.
This is easily done by right shifting the screen width by four.  We can
then count bins across the screen, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">hedge</code> is the end of the next bin.</p>

<p>If you look at Fig. 14 below, you can see how well our division matched
the screen.</p>

<p>We can now calculate the colors for the long top bars using a basic case
statment.  If we are in the first position, output a black, otherwise if
we are in the second position, etc.</p>

<p>The logic for all three sections is identical at this point.</p>

<p>You may also wish to note that, just like we did with the ALU, we are
calculating color bars even when we’ll be outputting the color from a
different bar.  We’ll do a downselect in a moment to get the right color
for each row.</p>

<p>Indeed, when it comes to generating row information, the logic is very
similar to the horizontal logic above.  We divide the screen by sixteen,
and keep track of which sixteenth of the screen we are within at any
given time.</p>

<p>The biggest difference between this logic and the horizontal logic is the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">dline</code> item.  This is used to keep the <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_newline</code> signals following the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i_newframe</code>, but before the first line of the image, from adjusting our
counter.  Perhaps you’ll recall from Fig. 12 above that the horizontal sync’s,
and so the <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_newline</code> signal, continued even during the vertical blanking
period.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">dline</code> above helps us avoid counting lines during this period.</p>

<p>You can see how well we did this in Fig. 15 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 15: Dividing the image vertically into 16 parts</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/llvga-testvdiv.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>We can then determine the final outgoing pixel by selecting on which sixteenth
of the image vertically we are on.  This is captured by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">yline</code> value
we just calculated above.</p>

<p>That just about explains everything!  The only thing we’ve left out is the
gradient sections.</p>

<p>The gradient sections were a bit more challenging.  To do them properly, the
image needed to be fully divided, so that a variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">hfrac</code> would smoothly
go from zero to overflow as it crossed from one edge of the image to another.
This means that we need to add to <code class="highlighter-rouge">hfrac</code> a value equal to one divided by the
image width on every clock tick.  Well call this the step size, <code class="highlighter-rouge">h_step</code>.</p>

<p>If we knew what <code class="highlighter-rouge">h_step</code> was, the logic would be as simple as,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_pixclk</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">hfrac</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">FRACB</code> bits in width, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">h_step</code> needs to be
set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^FRACB / width</code>.</p>

<p>Ouch!  Divides are hard in digital logic.  Do we really have to do a divide?</p>

<p>Can we cheat instead?  In this case, we certainly can!</p>

<p>Let’s check at the end of every line how close we came.  If we went too far,
then let’s lower <code class="highlighter-rouge">h_step</code>, otherwise if <code class="highlighter-rouge">hfrac</code> didn’t go far enough, we’ll
increase <code class="highlighter-rouge">h_step</code>.  It’s a basic control loop solution, and it will take
roughly <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^FRACB/width</code> lines to converge (remember, there are <code class="highlighter-rouge">FRACB</code> bits
in our <code class="highlighter-rouge">hfrac</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">h_step</code>.  In other words, we’ll converge within about a
hundred lines for 640x480 resolution, or about 64 lines for a 1280x1024
resolution..  This is usually enough to hide the fact that the divide hasn’t
converged until the time that the value is needed.</p>

<p>Notice how we just increment or decrement <code class="highlighter-rouge">h_step</code> based upon how close
we got to the right answer at the end of the line.</p>

<p>Now that we have this fractional counter that wraps at the line width,
we can calculate gradient values for our gradient sections.  We’ll set the
output (again) depending upon which sixteenth of the horizontal we are in.
Only this time, we’ll use the top four bits of this fractional counter
to determine the section.</p>

<p>Once you get past this <code class="highlighter-rouge">FRACB-4</code> bit, everything should be incrementing
nicely from the left of the interval to the right.</p>

<p>Our first actual section is red.  For this color, we want red pixels ranging
from zero to maximum, and then no blue or grean.  (<code class="highlighter-rouge">mid_off</code> is an <code class="highlighter-rouge">8'h0</code>).
During this section, we also know that <code class="highlighter-rouge">hfrac[FRACB-5:0]</code> will be slowly
counting from zero to overflow as well.  If we add a higher order bit,
we can get this gradual counter to gently cross two intervals.</p>

<p>That’s it for the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/vgatestsrc.v">test
design</a>.
Did you notice the format of the logic?
In general, everything but the <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> cordinate based variables reset on an
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i_newline</code>.  Colors were then chosen for each horizontal region, and then a
(nearly final) color choice was made by examining which vertical region
we were in.  The last step was to add a white border around the screen,
just to make certain we have our timing right.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Success with video really depends upon your ability to debug your logic.
The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA simulator</a> can make that easier,
by allowing you to “see” how your logic actually creates images.  Not only
that, but because it is a simulation, you can get access to every wire
and every flip-flop within it.  Want to see how fast the division
converges?  Want to see what the various video signals look like in
practice?  Or stop halt a simulation on an error?  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim">VGA
simulator</a> can do all that and more.</p>

<p>We also walked through several pieces of a demonstration video design.
We discussed the generation of the various video signals, and even
walked through how they could be used to create a video test-signal.
That said, in many ways we didn’t walk through the critical piece of code
required for any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">frame buffer</a> based
design–<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/master/rtl/imgfifo.v">the code</a>
that reads from the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">frame buffer</a> in memory
and sends a valid pixel to our low level controller.  This, however,
we’ll need to leave for next time.</p>

<p>I know that some have said that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a> is an outdated standard.
Everything is moving to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI</a> and beyond.
Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI</a> is a bit more difficult
to generate and work with.  There are more steps to it and more protocol
missteps that can be made.  That said, when I get to the point where I’m ready
to post the HDMI simulator, you’ll see that it isn’t all that much more
complicated than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector">VGA</a>
simulator we’ve just looked through.  Indeed, the same could be
said of the MIPI based CSI-2 simulator I have …</p>
