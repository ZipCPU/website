  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today, I’m starting what will likely be the slow process of
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verifying</a>
the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.  I’m going to use
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys">yosys</a> for this process initially, but given
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>’s ability to
run multiple formal configurations as separate tasks, I will probably need to
switch after I get some distance along.</p>

<p>At this point in the game, I’ve already <a href="/blog/2018/01/22/formal-progress.html">formally proven all of the
components</a>
of the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.
What remains is to prove the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/zipcpu.v">CPU itself</a>.</p>

<p>So here’s my question: How many bugs would you expect to find in a “working”
soft-core CPU?  One?  Ten?  Twenty?  One hundred?  Shall we count?  I propose
keeping a running log of the bugs I find in the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> while using
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally methods</a>.
Perhaps this log will help to convince you the value of
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally methods</a>,
perhaps not.  Either way, I’ll keep it accurate to the information I discover.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The memory manager refused to release the bus if the response came back
on the same cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain errors should cause the CPU to halt–such as encountering a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
when reading from instruction memory.  Due to a (now locally fixed) bug
in the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>, these errors
would not cause the CPU to halt if they were one of the first couple
instructions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> is designed so that
memory reads or writes <em>never</em> need to be rolled back. This is to
facilitate using the memory bus for reading and
writing peripherals, such as the serial port.  Reads from such peripherals
have side effects that cannot be rolled back.  The formal methods however,
discovered an example where reading into the program counter, such as during
an indirect jump, my cause a following memory instruction to need to be
rolled back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s current approach to
the compressed instruction set (CIS)
is to prevent the CPU from interrupting in the middle of a CIS instruction.
Formal methods, however, found an internal accounting bug which prevented
this logic from working properly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several bugs have been found in the debug infrastructure, allowing an
external debugger to change registers internal to the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.</p>

    <p>In one example, this was violating the rules the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> uses when issuing
pipelined memory instructions.</p>

    <p>In another example, during a divide that was to write its results into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R0</code>,
the external debug infrastructure was allowed to write to a register,
say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R1</code>.  This would cause the divide to write its results into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R1</code> upon
completion, rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R0</code>.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> has
therefore been adjusted so that the debug infrastructure
can only modify the value of a register if the CPU has been fully halted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The flag indicating that the CPU is fully halted was not properly
implemented.  Specifically, the CPU might declare it was halted in the middle
of a CIS instruction when the second half of the instruction still needed
to be flushed through the pipeline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a multi-cycle ALU operation (i.e. one of the multiplies), the flags
were being set before the operation was complete</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clock-less version of the instruction decoder, used by the formal
properties alone to know what to expect from an instruction, didn’t match
the actual instruction decoder when it came to whether or not SIM
instructions should cause an illegal interrupt exception</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The divide wouldn’t wait for a multiply to complete before starting.  Such
a multiply might have provided the divide with its operand, but due to this
bug the divide input would’ve been the prior value of the register.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under certain circumstances in the pipeline, the break instruction would
get bypassed.</p>

    <p>I’m actually looking forward to simplifying this break logic by merging it
with the illegal instruction logic, since the two do the same thing in
different ways.  I’m holding off on this for now, however.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Writes to the user PC register, such as by the debug port or even the ALU,
   while in supervisor (not user) mode, would corrupt any logic depending
   upon the user PC register that was already in the pipeline.  Hence, the
   pipeline needs to be cleared following any such write.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After making several fixes, the memory instruction following an illegal
instruction would be issued.  This error isn’t so much a bug in the working
CPU, but rather a bug in my pipeline logic rewrite.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps this would never happen.  However, the memory controller wouldn’t
stall when it ran out of internal memory to keep track of where the
write back results would be written to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On an early branch or an illegal instruction, the valid memory instruction
flag was still being set, eventually violating the contract with the memory
device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The switch to interrupt flag wasn’t waiting for any ongoing memory
operations to complete first</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a divide error, the memory unit would still issue an instruction.
This creates a problem because a memory operation to a peripheral device
cannot be withdrawn, as the CPU tries to switch to its exception handling
code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under certain circumstances, the CPU would continue issuing instructions
following a bus error or division by zero error.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, I’m going to stop counting.  It’s not because there are so
many errors remaining, but rather because its no longer clear which of the
remaining errors were originally
in the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
and which ones were added while trying to fix the earlier bugs.</p>

<h2 id="bugs-in-the-formal-properties">Bugs in the Formal Properties</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The formal properties within the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/zipcpu.v">core</a>,
as well as the abstracted components, are still quite immature.
Multiple bugs are still being found within them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/ex/wbdblpriarb.v">Wishbone
arbiter</a>
had a careless assumption within it.  This prevented the arbiter from ever
being fully tested and verified.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
recognizes two memory regions: a local region for CPU-specific
peripherals from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff000000</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xffffffff</code> (used by the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/zipsystem.v">ZipSystem</a>,
and a more global memory
region (everything else).  Crossing regions within the same memory operation
is a fault that needs to be prevented in software, and the formal
properties for describing this fault were <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assert()</code> functions rather than
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">restrict()</code> functions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="current-status">Current status</h2>

<p>I’m currently fully verifying the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s
capability using an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/dev/bench/formal/abs_prefetch.v">abstract
prefetch</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/dev/bench/formal/abs_div.v">abstract
divide</a>,
and an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/dev/bench/formal/abs_mpy.v">abstract
multiply</a>.
Thanks to SymbiYosys and “abc pdr”, the pipeline properties I’ve now verified
constitutes a full formal proof (BMC + induction) of the first set of
formal properties for the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.
A second stage of properties have since been added, dependent upon the
synthesizer define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PHASE_ONE</code>. The proof of this second set of properties
remains ongoing.</p>

<p>First, the formal properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve proven that the assumptions within all of the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s
sub-modules hold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve manage to verify that the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s
pipeline logic won’t accidentally “delete” an instruction in the pipeline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve also added the properties that the operands given to the
ALU, memory, or divide unit, need to be valid.</p>

    <p>This portion of the proof is ongoing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following any ALU or divide instruction, only the correct register will
ever be written if at all–I haven’t dealt with predicates yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BREAK</code> instructions never pass the OP stage as desired.  This makes certain
these instructions will not increment the PC when encountered.  This is
very similar to an illegal operand instruction, and the logic for these
may yet be merged.  For now, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BREAK</code> instruction bypasses the ALU
stage of the CPU as desired.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I haven’t gotten to the cover properties yet, those are yet to come.  As a
result, I may have carelessly assumed away a portion of the proof and can’t
tell yet.</p>

<p>Here’s how far I’ve gotten:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Without pipelining the memory bus, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> made it for a full 40 clocks
in a bounded model check.  This was the extent of the test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the pipelined memory bus, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> has formally passed
<em>all of the formal properties</em> now written for it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The updated formal code is currently in a git repository branch that hasn’t
(yet) been pushed.  Upon request I have pushed components of this
proof into the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/tree/dev">dev branc</a>,
although I’d still be a bit embarrassed to present the (not quite working)
CPU yet.  This includes the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/dev/bench/formal/abs_mpy.v">abstract
multiply</a>
mentioned above, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/dev/rtl/core/mpyop.v">multiply
module</a> that it
replaces.</p>

    <p>My apologies to all that have indicated an interest in seeing this code.
Thank you for your interest.  I guess it surprised me a bit.
I’m just not quite ready yet to post the code–mostly because things aren’t
fully working.  I do anticipate fully sharing this code in due time.  If
you are really interested in seeing this before it is complete, then
please send me an e-mail and I will consider placing it on
<a href="https://gitlab.com">gitlab</a> where
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">sponsors</a> can have access to the current
work in progress.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can find my work in the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/tree/dev">dev branch</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">github repository</a>
for the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.  Specifically,
you can find the properties that I’m working with at the bottom of the core
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/dev/rtl/core/zipcpu.v">zipcpu.v</a>
Verilog file.  I’m using a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/dev/bench/formal/Makefile">“make”
file</a> within
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/tree/dev/bench/formal">bench/formal</a>
directory to control the process.</p>
