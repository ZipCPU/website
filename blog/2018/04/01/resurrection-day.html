    <p>Buddha <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha#Relics">is dead</a>.</p>

<p>Mohammed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad#Death_and_tomb">is dead</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/deu/34/1">Moses died</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/27/50">Jesus died</a> as well, but unlike
these others <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/28/7">He is dead no more</a>.</p>

<p>This simple fact <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/17/31">makes Christianity
different</a>.</p>

<p>Today, we celebrate this difference.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-jesus-special">What makes Jesus special?</h2>

<p>Jesus knew He was going to die.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
[<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/num/21/8">Num 21:8</a>],
even so must the Son of man be lifted up [i.e. crucified]: That whosoever
believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/3/14">John 3:14-15</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was His purpose in coming to the earth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?  Father, save me from this
hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.  Father, glorify thy name.
Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and
will glorify it again.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/12/27">John 12:27-28</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus also knew that He could raise Himself up from the grave long before
He was put to death.  This was a commandment given to Him by His Father,
the one we call God.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might
take it again.  No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.
I have the power to lay it down, and I have the power to take it again.
This command have I received of my Father.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/10/17">John 10:17-18</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The disciples were falsely accused of hiding His body.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we
slept.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/28/13">Mat 28:13</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In spite of this lie, no one found the missing body because there was no
missing body.  Jesus is no longer dead, He is risen!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they
said unto them, “Why seek ye the living among the dead?”
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/24/5">Luke 24:5</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(By the way, I love the song by this same name which comes from the musical
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roxCbUndmR0">The Choice</a> by Nate Copeland.
[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bM3S5fBYec">1</a>],
[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ-qPvYQNr4">2</a>],
[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2fg_hhDN94">3</a>],
[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osbuen8WkRI">4</a>])</em></p>

<p>The resurrection, evidenced by the empty tomb, proves the validity
of the message.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in
righteousness by that Man whom he hath ordained; whereof He hath given
assurance unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/17/31">Acts 17:31</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without the resurrection, there is no point in Christianity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is
vain [i.e. useless or pointless].  Yea, and we are found false witnesses of
God [i.e. liars]; because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ:
whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</p>

  <p>For if the dead rise not, then is Christ not raised: and if Christ be not
raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</p>

  <p>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1co/15/14">1Cor 15:14-19</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, were there no resurrection, then there would be no hope in living.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what
advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?  Let us eat and drink; for
tomorrow we die.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/eph/15/32">Eph 15:32</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there is a resurrection!  We know this from the testimony of those who
have seen him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/4/32">Acts 4:32</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or again,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to
the scriptures:
And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen
of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain to
this present, but some are fallen asleep.
After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/10/17">1 Cor 15:3-8</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also know this by the empty tomb, proving to all that He is the Christ!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made
the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/4/36">Acts 4:36</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="i-serve-a-risen-savior">I serve a risen Savior</h2>

<p>Because He lives, I have been
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/8/1">freed from my own personal sins</a>.</p>

<p>Because He lives, I no longer need to live a life
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/8/34">controlled by my own wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>Because He lives, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/10/28">I have a
future</a>.</p>

<p>Because He lives, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/col/3/23">I blog</a>.</p>

<p>Because He lives, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/6/37">you may choose to have a future
  as well</a>.</p>

<p>If you know Christ, then
please join me today in celebrating the risen Savior, which is Christ the Lord.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/7/23">do not know Him</a>,
or perhaps if you only know of or
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/2/19">about Him</a>,
then please let me invite you discover Him through the letters His disciples
wrote describing their time with him:
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/1">Matthew</a>,
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mar/1">Mark</a>,
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/1">Luke</a> and
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/1">John</a>.</p>
