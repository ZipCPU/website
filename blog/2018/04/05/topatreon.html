    <p>The <a href="https://zipcpu.com/">ZipCPU blog</a> has recently picked
up a lot of readers in light of my
<a href="/blog/2018/04/02/formal-cpu-bugs.html">recent on-going work</a>
to <a href="/blog/2018/04/02/formal-cpu-bugs.html">formally verify</a>
the entire <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.</p>

<p>To all of those new readers, <em>Welcome!</em>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zipcpu.com/">ZipCPU blog</a> is dedicated to helping
FPGA designers avoid getting stuck in
<a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA Hell</a>–a place where
<a href="/blog/2017/09/14/even-i-get-stuck.html">your design doesn’t work and you can’t figure out why
not</a>.  To this end,
I’ve presented techniques for <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">simulating your design using
Verilator</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/README.md">how to build a debugging
bus</a> for
command, control, and internal register and state inspection, <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">how to build
your own internal logic
analyzer</a>,
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">how to use my own wishbone
scope</a>,
<a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">how the VCD file format expresses your logic
trace</a>,

algorithm</a>,
<a href="/blog/2017/06/17/why-network-debugging.html">network debugging</a>,
and more.</p>

<p>Recently I’ve started learning about <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
verification</a>,
and so I’ve added <a href="/formal/formal.html">that
topic</a>
to my list as well.  As a result there have now been
<a href="/formal/formal.html">several articles</a>
on how to <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally
verify</a>
your logic as and after you have put it together, and <a href="/blog/2018/03/14/is-formal-hard.html">the value of formal
verification</a>.</p>

<p>What you as a reader need to know, however, is that these articles are
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">sponsor supported</a>.  If you find this blog
valuable, and would like to see it continue, then please consider becoming
one of my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">Patreon Sponsors</a>.</p>

<p>One of the perks of being a
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">sponsor</a>
is that I am responsive to the topics my
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">sponsors</a>
are interested in.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">sponsors</a>.
So, here’s a short list of some of the upcoming topics which I think would be
fun to post about.  If you are one of my
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/ZipCPU">sponsors</a>,
then please consider yourself invited to contact me and let me know
which of these (or other) topics you might be interested in.  There
is also a more complete list of both past and upcoming topics in the site
<a href="/topics.html">topics</a> list as well.</p>

<p>So, without further delay, here are some of the topics I am considering
writing about in the near future, should <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15">the Lord be
willing</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ZBasic ZipCPU Peripheral</strong>: Some time ago, I promised I was going to
discuss how easy it was to add a peripheral to the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic">ZBasic</a>
using <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a>.
I am still fully intending to do this, although I am somewhat struggling to
decide what that example peripheral should be–there are just too many
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU?tab=repositories">possibilities</a>.  Feel free
to make a suggestion if you would like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quadratic Sinewave generation</strong>: <a href="/dsp/2017/08/30/cordic.html">CORDIC sinewave
generation</a> is really cool,
but it can also be logically expensive within an FPGA.
A potentially cheaper algorithm, requiring only two multiplies, would be to
apply our <a href="/dsp/2018/03/30/quadratic.html">quadratic interpolation
techniques</a>
to generating a cleaner sine wave.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html">Asynchronous FIFO</a></strong>:
I have a nice formal proof of <a href="http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO1.pdf">Cliff Cummings’
asynchronous FIFO
design</a>
that I think would be valuable to present as well.  Unlike many of <a href="/formal/formal.html">my other
formal articles</a>, this one requires
a formal solution across more than one clock domain, and for arbitrary
clock speeds.  This will add to the interest and value of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ethernet CRC</strong>: When I recently built a Ethernet CRC module for the 1Gb
Ethernet port of the <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications">Nexys Video
board</a>,
I was surprised at how much formal methods could help simplify
the complicated math of a multi-stepping CRC generator.  This would
therefore be a fun topic to share, as there is a lot of practical
information within it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dual I/O SPI flash</strong>: While I am personally quite biased towards a <a href="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">Quad
SPI flash implementation</a>,
recent events have led me to need to build a
<em>Dual I/O SPI flash</em> implementation for a couple of logic challenged
implementations.  This means that this controller should be simple enough to
both present and understand, and makes a nice blog topic</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>TinyFPGA</strong>: I’m also building a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/tinyzip">TinyFPGA BX
design</a> using the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>, and would love to blog about
this design.  Yes, the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> does
fit nicely on that board with room to spare (when <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/tinyzip/blob/master/rtl/cpu/cpudefs.v">properly
trimmed</a>),
however my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/rtl/qflashxpress.v">minimal flash
controller</a>
needed to be redesigned, and my C++ <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sim/verilated/qspiflashsim.cpp">flash
simulator</a>
needed to be adjusted to get this to work.  Once I’ve finished verifying
that I can program and run the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
on this board, then it would be fun to describe my experiences.  Because of
the dependence upon the flash controller, however, this post would follow the
discussion of the <strong>Dual I/O SPI flash</strong> design.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Some Simple Formal Verification Proofs</strong>: It might be nice to return to our
(event) <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/generating-timing.html">timing control solutions
post</a>,
and take a new look at them in light of <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
verification</a>.
For example, how would you verify that a timer provides you with the right
number of clock ticks, or how would you speed up an otherwise exceptionally
long proof.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prefetch with Cache</strong>: The
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> has a 1-way instruction
cache that would be fun to present, and would also conclude our discussion
of prefetch methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Movement</strong>: One of the sad realities of FPGA work is that its not all
about data transformation.  There’s a lot to be done in data movement as well.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZiPCPU</a> contains a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/wbdmac.v">DMA controller</a>
that can be set up to automatically move data from one place to another within
any <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">wishbone based
design</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/peripherals/wbdmac.v">This
component</a>,
and its formal properties would be useful to many of my readers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstraction in Formal Verification</strong>: The recent
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
<a href="/blog/2018/04/02/formal-cpu-bugs.html">verification work</a>
depends heavily on formal verification concepts of abstraction and
invariance.  Both techniques are useful when trying to break a complicated
design, such as a full CPU, down into its subcomponents.</p>

    <p>This article would present abstraction.  In short, abstraction is based upon
the statement that if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> implies <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> must also imply
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>.  The figures and outline of this lesson would be taken from the
formal verification course I’ve put together for
<a href="https://www.symbioticeda.com">Symbiotic EDA</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/formal/2018/04/23/invariant.html">Invariance in Formal Verification</a></strong>: Invariance is a second very powerful
tool that can be used to simplify the formal prove of a component.  Put
simply, if you can prove the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> is true, you no longer need to prove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>
anymore.  The difference over what can, and cannot, be proven using this
technique can be drastic.</p>

    <p>The figures and outline of this lesson would also be taken from the
formal verification course I’ve put together for
<a href="https://www.symbioticeda.com">Symbiotic EDA</a>, just like the proposed
abstraction post discussed above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>More filtering</strong>: We left our discussion of filtering incomplete, and
so I’d still like to come back to demonstrate both
<a href="/dsp/2018/05/17/slowsymf.html">symmetric</a> and halfband
filters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dhrystone</strong>: Also on my list of items to discuss is Dhrystone, the
outdated-yet-still-useful CPU bench mark.  For all of you who are
interested in comparing your CPU’s performance against Dhrystone, this
article would take a quick look at how Dhrystone can be run within a
Verilator simulation, and how I’ve gone about interpreting the results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Synchronization</strong>: One common problem in <a href="/dsp/dsp.html">digital signal
processing</a> is the
“two-clock” problem where data comes into the algorithm on one clock, and
yet needs to be output on the edges of an unrelated clock.  Now that we’ve
spent some time with
<a href="/dsp/2018/03/30/quadratic.html">interpolation</a>,
as well as <a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">how to build a simple PLL
module</a>, it only makes
sense that we would connect these two concepts to be able to synchronize
two data streams.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="/blog/2019/06/28/genclk.html">Generating an Arbitrary Clock Signal</a></strong>: I also have a simple design
component that can be used to generate a clock signal at an arbitrary
frequency, without requiring any additional clock chips.  (The FPGA still
needs its input clock.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Building a HyperRAM controller</strong>:
<a href="http://www.cypress.com/products/hyperram-memory">HyperRAM</a> is a powerful
RAM communication protocol.  Unlike
DDR3 SDRAM, building a controller for
<a href="http://www.cypress.com/products/hyperram-memory">HyperRAM</a>
doesn’t require undocumented chip features.  This article would discuss
such a controller, both how to build it as well as how to formally verify
that it works.</p>

    <p>If there’s enough demand, a separate article could discuss how to build a
simulation component for this device.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve made it this far, let share this with you: I’m creating today
a <a href="/formal/formal.html">formal page</a> which will capture
all of my formal verification posts.  This should make it easier for someone
who is only interested in <a href="/formal/formal.html">formal
verification</a> to find articles that
discuss or provide examples of <a href="/formal/formal.html">formal
verification</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/formal/formal.html">This new topical page</a>
joins my prior <a href="/dsp/dsp.html">DSP topical page</a>.  However,
<em>all</em> articles will remain on the blog’s main page.</p>

<p>Finally, if you are one of my
