  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/shw219/advice_for_studying_the_axi_specification/">once asked on Reddit, how should one go about learning the AXI
protocol</a>?
The following summarizes my basic answer.</p>

<p>First off, don’t start with Xilinx’s example designs.  Sorry, but their
examples are horribly broken.  Even their demo <a href="/blog/2021/08/28/axi-rules.html">AXI Stream master is
broken</a>.  It’s a shame
that they’ve neither fixed these designs, nor updated their training materials
to acknowledge that their basic designs are broken.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right; padding: 25px"><caption>Fig. 1, Basic Roadmap for Learning AXI</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/learning-axi/roadmap.svg" alt="" width="280" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Others have suggested that the best place to start is by learning handshaking,
and most of the AXI stream protocol is just that: handshaking.  I would agree.
Therefore, I would recommend that anyone starting out begin by learning
<a href="/blog/2021/08/28/axi-rules.html">AXI’s handshaking rules</a>.
As <a href="/blog/2021/08/28/axi-rules.html">that article</a> will
explain, the AXI stream protocol is little more than simple handshaking, and
you can (mostly) ignore the TID, TSTRB, TKEEP, and TDEST signals.  This
is also where you’ll discover how Xilinx got their example AXI stream master
messed up, and where you’ll learn how easy it would be to fix it.</p>

<p>Once you understand <a href="/blog/2021/08/28/axi-rules.html">AXI
handshaking</a>, I’d then
recommend learning about
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skidbuffers</a>. Without
them, you’ll never get better than 50% throughput without violating the
AXI specification.</p>

<p>The next place I’d go would be to  <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">look into
AXI-lite</a>. Beware of
backpressure! It has caused Xilinx (and others unnamed) no end of headaches,
and forms the backdrop for many of the bugs in their example designs. If you
want a working example design to start from, check out <a href="/blog/2020/03/08/easyaxil.html">this example
design</a> that I
often use myself when working with AXI-lite.  You might also wish to look over
<a href="/blog/2021/05/22/vhdlaxil.html">this post, describing how to fix Xilinx’s (broken) AXI-lite VHDL
example</a>.</p>

<p>For most use cases, you can stop there.  AXI-lite will get you just about
everywhere you need to go.  For most of the things you might need the
full AXI specification for, you can already find example open source or vendor
designs that’ll work.
(<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">DMA</a>s,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">MM2S</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">S2MM</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">virtual FIFO</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">video frame buffer reading</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">video frame buffer writing</a>, etc.)</p>

<p>If you are interested in moving past AXI-lite, then it’s time to understand <a href="/blog/2019/04/27/axi-addr.html">AXI
addressing</a>,
and the various FIX, WRAP, and INCR addressing modes and how the AxSIZE field
impacts them.  This is important.  Xilinx <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">didn’t even try to get this right
in their example</a>, and I’ve
seen plenty of ASIC designs that even get this addressing messed up.  You will
need to understand this before diving into building your first full AXI slave.
Indeed, I’ve used the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axi_addr.v">next AXI address
module</a> built
and presented in that article in many of my own designs.</p>

<p>Once you understand addressing, or at least once you’ve simplified it enough
that you can work with it, then the next step would be to build a <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">fully
capable AXI slave</a>.</p>

<p>What will you gain by writing an AXI slave over an AXI-Lite slave?  Not much.
Seriously.  There’s not a lot of performance gain to be had by building an
AXI (full) slave over that already gained by building an AXI-Lite slave–at
least, not much gain to be had for most uses.  What performance difference might
you see?  Well, following <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axi2axilite.v">a good AXI to AXI-lite
bridge</a>, you
might find yourself
loosing about 2 clocks of <em>latency</em> per transaction.  That’s it.  Following a
poor AXI to AXI-lite bridge?  In that case, you might lose 4-8 clocks of
<em>throughput</em> per transaction.  Of course, you could always switch back to a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axi2axilite.v">better bridge</a>
to recover this lost throughput–so there’s really not a lot to
be gained by switching from an AXI-lite slave to an AXI (full) one.</p>

<p>When it comes to AXI masters, however, that’s a different story.  Still, I
would similarly recommend you start with an <a href="/blog/2020/03/23/wbm2axisp.html">AXI-Lite
master</a>. Technically, such
a master should be able to be just as fast as an AXI full master.  Practically
and sadly, many designs cripple their AXI-lite implementations. (Hello, Xilinx?)</p>

<p>A full discussion of <a href="/blog/2020/06/16/axiaddr-limits.html">AXI masters gets
difficult</a>.
It’s hard enough that I haven’t (yet) figured out how to simplify the material
enough to write a post on how to build a general purpose AXI master–the
addressing is just that hard to get right in general. (It usually takes me
a couple of days to get right–even when building my own.) However, you are
welcome to examine <a href="/blog/2021/06/28/master-examples.html">some of the AXI masters I’ve written and
posted</a> if you’d like.</p>

<p>Among those <a href="/blog/2021/06/28/master-examples.html">AXI master
examples</a> are
two worth mentioning here since I’ve written articles about them.  The first
discusses how to build a <a href="/zipcpu/2021/04/17/axilops.html">memory controller for the ZipCPU using the AXI-Lite
protocol</a>, whereas the
second discusses the <a href="/zipcpu/2021/09/30/axiops.html">modifications necessary to upgrade that memory controller
to AXI (full)</a>.  This <a href="/zipcpu/2021/09/30/axiops.html">second
article</a> goes over the
AXI Exclusive Access protocol (AxLOCK, and EXOKAY), and then how to go about
building a master that uses it–although I only really know of CPU use cases
for such a protocol.  It also discusses some of the challenging interactions
between AxADDR and AxSIZE.</p>

<p>If you are really going to dive deeply into the AXI protocol, then it will
quickly become important to know <a href="/blog/2021/08/14/axiperf.html">how to measure AXI
performance</a>.
Just what kind of performance are you achieving, what is possible, and what
can you expect are all good questions you’ll want to know how to answer.</p>

<p>The above will get you most of the way. However, it will also leave you with
questions about what AxCACHE, AxPROT, and AxQOS are for, or when you should
use the AxID field.  Indeed, you may leave wondering about AxSIZE as well, and
why it’s an important part of the protocol.  For a discussion of these, let me
point you to a reddit question of my own from some time ago: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/egkrce/is_axi_too_complicated/">is AXI too
complicated</a>?</p>

<h2 id="formally-verifying-axi">Formally Verifying AXI</h2>

<p>Not that long ago, I was asked about the possibility of writing a course on how
to formally verify AXI components.  At the time, I sketched out the following
outline for such a course–an outline that primarily matches most of the
progression above.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The course would start with a <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">quick review of formal
methods</a>: what
are assertions and assumptions, and what are some of the <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">unique challenges
associated with
induction</a>.</li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig. 2, Lessons that might compose a course in formally verifying AXI components</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/learning-axi/courseware.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Indeed, when you get to AXI full,
   <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
   becomes a necessity.  AXI is sufficiently complicated to limit a bounded
   model check to somewhere between 20-40 cycles.  As a result, no bounded model
   check will be sufficient to verify one or more 256-beat bursts.  A complete
   proof, therefore, <em>requires</em>
   <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>.
   It’s important here to understand how it works, and what challenges you
   might expect when working with it.</p>

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    <p>As above, the next step would be to look into AXI Stream, and in
particular how to handle
<a href="/blog/2021/08/28/axi-rules.html">Handshaking</a>
and <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skidbuffers</a>.
Specifically, I’d go over the assertions necessary to describe an
<a href="/blog/2021/08/28/axi-rules.html">AXI handshake</a>, and the
need for <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skidbuffers</a>.
The lesson would end with a
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skidbuffer</a>
exercise of some type–perhaps simply requiring a student to build their own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next step would be
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-Lite</a>.  The big
difference between
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-Lite</a> and the
bare <a href="/blog/2021/08/28/axi-rules.html">handshaking</a>
discussion is that you need to count outstanding read and write requests when
using <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-Lite</a>.  Every
read request requires one (and only one) response.  Write requests
are similar and also require a single response, however a write request is
not complete until there’s been a request on both write address and write
data channels.  In general, though, the only thing we’re adding above and
beyond the basic
<a href="/blog/2021/08/28/axi-rules.html">handshaking</a>
are some simple counters as well as some assertions tied to those counters.</p>

    <p>An exercise for this portion of the course might involve verifying a given
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-Lite</a> module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While AXI-lite is a great protocol for register handling, it’s also
important to know your design handles registers properly.  Therefore, I’d
dedicate a lesson to discussing <a href="/blog/2020/12/19/axil-register-checking.html">how to verify that registers are read or
written correctly</a>.</p>

    <p>A good exercise here would be to modify the exercise from the AXI-lite
lesson, so that it verifies the register within.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can now discuss <a href="/blog/2019/04/27/axi-addr.html">AXI
  addressing</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would then be time to dive into AXI full.  This topic is so large,
however, that it really needs to be broken up.  Therefore, I’d start with
how to verify handling a single read burst.  The basics of single read
burst counting are pretty simple: you need to count the number of bursts
that are outstanding, and the number of remaining outstanding items in
each burst.</p>

    <p>This might be where I’d introduce the exercise of verifying an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/demofull.v">AXI full
slave</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is also where the easy part ends.  How, for example, shall you verify
that the number of beats returned for a given burst read request is correct?
That’s a touch harder–especially when you need to start tracking multiple
outstanding bursts.</p>

    <p>From there, I’d move on to discuss how to verify out-of-order returns, and
how to handle verifying packet ID’s.</p>

    <p>This leads to the task of verifying an AXI full slave that requires multiple
beats to process requests given to it.  A simple example might be an AXI
SRAM controller, where the SRAM requires one (or more) clocks from
request to response and where the read command can only be issued once.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write handling is more challenging than read handling.  Specifically, AXI
write requests split the write address and data into two channels, and
formally verifying both channels can require a bit of synchronization within
the formal properties.  Once the channels are synchronized, however,
verification returns to being as easy as counting bursts and beats again.</p>

    <p>Yes, there are a couple new requirements, although once the channels are
synchronized these are minimal.  Primarily, the extra requirements deal
with those packets for which AWSIZE is less than a full word, or for which
the initial AWADDR isn’t word aligned.  In these cases, there’s the
additional requirement that write beats only contain strobes for the
correct bytes.  For example, if AWADDR is odd, then the WSTRB[0] of the
first beat must be zero.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exclusive Access.  Exclusive access is AXI’s method of handling atomic
requests.  These really aren’t all that hard to understand or model.
Indeed, they are easier to deal with than read or write bursts.  Still,
I would place exclusive access handling late in the course, not because
of how easy or difficult it is, but more because of how few things actually
need it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: right; padding: 25px"><caption>Fig. 3, It can be a real challenge to verify a design containing a FIFO</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/learning-axi/fifo-challenge.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<ol start="10">
  <li>That brings us to the FIFO Challenge.  FIFOs are fairly easy to verify on
   their own.  Sadly, they become much harder to verify when they are used
   within something.  AXI, however, is very much built around the concept
   of FIFOs.  How to verify something that has a FIFO within it is something
   we’d need to discuss here.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you get past the FIFO challenge, it then becomes possible to build AXI
   components that can handle any number of multiple bursts at a time.  When
   would you need something like this?  When building an AXI
   <a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">interconnect</a> or
   a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">DMA</a>
   of some type.  Both would make good examples of components that might
   need this technology.</p>

<p>At least, these are my current thoughts on what lessons I might teach were I
to create a course in formally verifying AXI components.  Given that every
piece of commercial IP I’ve ever built has required some form of AXI interface,
I wouldn’t be surprised to find such a course to be an in-demand topic.
I would just need to find a way to clear enough time out of my schedule to
create it.</p>

<h2 id="axi-design-exercises">AXI Design Exercises</h2>

<p>When learning any new topic, its important to exercise your new knowledge
as you learn it.  Here’s a list, therefore, containing a progression of
exercises with increasing difficulty that you might find valuable when
learning AXI.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 25px"><caption>Fig. 4, Practice exercises, for use in learning AXI</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/learning-axi/exercises.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Build and verify an AXI Stream component.  A good example of this might
be either a DSP component or perhaps a FIFO of some type.  Perhaps the
simplest example I might come up with would be a frequency shifter based
upon an internal <a href="/dsp/2017/08/30/cordic.html">CORDIC</a>.</p>

    <p>Other examples include stream processing network packets–such as a
stream component that might recognize, encrypt or decrypt a UDP packet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build and verify an AXI-lite bus slave</p>

    <p>This project is actually pretty easy.  I’d have you start with the
<a href="/blog/2020/03/08/easyaxil.html">EasyAXIL design</a>, and
then modify it for some purpose.  Perhaps that might be to create a
GPIO or UART controller from it, or to turn it into a basic timer
peripheral of some type.  Any of these exercises would be fairly simple,
since the <a href="/blog/2020/03/08/easyaxil.html">EasyAXIL
design</a> is just
that easy to work with and from.  Even better, it comes with all the details
you need to formally verify how well it handles bus transactions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simplest bus master to build is a basic, scripted, one request at a time
bus master using AXI-lite.  <a href="/blog/2021/12/30/dbgaxil.html">This
article</a> presents both
such a bus master, and a usage description of why you might wish to build
one.  The master is easy enough to verify, and so might make a good practice
start at building your first AXI-lite bus master.</p>

    <p>Indeed, a scripted AXI-lite bus master is not really all that much more
complex than a basic <a href="/zipcpu/2021/04/17/axilops.html">AXI-Lite CPU memory
unit</a>, so
building such a memory unit might also fit nicely here.  From an exercise
standpoint, however, the <a href="/zipcpu/2021/04/17/axilops.html">CPU memory
unit</a> has to deal with
two protocols, both that of the CPU and that of AXI-lite, meaning that the
<a href="/zipcpu/2021/04/17/axilops.html">CPU memory unit</a> might be
more complex than this exercise would require.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A more complicated AXI-lite bus master, and certainly one with more interest,
might be to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilfetch.html">add a small FIFO to a CPU instruction fetch
unit</a>.</p>

    <p>This exercise is only slightly more complex than the scripted memory
controller of the last exercise.  Specifically, what should the fetch unit
do when, mid fetch, the CPU tells it that it no longer wants the values
currently being fetched but instead wants to start over from a new address?</p>

    <p>Before leaving this example, let me quickly outline the number of uses I’ve
found for such a FIFO based AXI-lite bus controller.  The most basic use
is in scripting a scatter-gather DMA.  I’ve also found it useful for
scripting I2C or SPI transactions from a script in memory somewhere.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That would roughly exhaust the exercises needed to learn how to work with
both <a href="/blog/2021/08/28/axi-rules.html">AXI handshaking</a> and
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>.  From here, it
would be time to move on to the full AXI bus protocol.</p>

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    <p>The first (and simplest) exercise would be to build (and verify) an AXI
(full) slave.  A specific performance goal would be that this slave should
be able to handle a throughput of one beat per clock–even when crossing
the boundaries between multiple burst requests.</p>

    <p>A classic design example which might work well here would be a single
port SRAM controller.  Such a controller would require an internal
arbiter to select which of the read or write channel would be allowed
access to the SRAM.</p>

    <p>A bonus exercise might be to make that slave able to handle exclusive
access requests, but this would need to be bonus.  Not all AXI slaves
need or want exclusive access.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good exercise for building an AXI master might be to build an AXI based
cache of some type.  At this point, however, there’s no real way around
the two protocols required: you’d need to support both a cache-to-CPU
protocol as well as the AXI protocol.</p>

    <p>The cache would be the first type of component requiring burst access.
It can be kept simple enough as to only require a single burst at a time.
Bonus points would include using WRAP addressing, or exclusive access
(data cache only).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you want good bus performance, however, you need to be able to build 
a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">DMA</a>.
The skills involved in building (and verifying) a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">memory to memory
DMA controller</a>
should be the last AXI skills you will need to learn.</p>

    <p>The key new feature learned when building a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">DMA
controller</a>,
not present in any of the prior AXI components, is the simple reality that
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">a DMA</a>
needs to be able to blast as much information across the bus as possible in
as few beats as possible.  This means you’d need to be able to verify that
your design can issue and track multiple outstanding burst requests at any
given time.</p>

    <p>To simplify this project to something that might still be accomplished
within a class, I might suggest limiting this DMA to aligned words only.
Obviously, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">a DMA which can handle both unaligned addresses and unaligned
lengths</a> is
more useful, but the challenge involved in verfiying
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">such a DMA</a>
might be too much for an introductory course in AXI design.</p>

    <p>The neat part of this exercise however, is that once you can build a
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">basic AXI DMA</a>,
you can then build all kinds of specialized data movers, such as:
stream or packet to memory DMA’s, or the reverse memory to packet or stream
DMA, video DMAs, virtual FIFOs, and more.  None of these items are really
all that much more complex than the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">basic AXI DMA</a>
is in the first place.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>While these example design exercises start simple, they do end up quite
complex–as they should.  This isn’t quite as complex as AXI gets, however.
More complicated AXI designs might include bus upsizers, downsizers, or even
<a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">crossbars</a>.  While such
components are more complex, they aren’t really required for <em>learning</em> AXI.
If you can handle the prior exercises, then you should then know enough to
build any of these more complex components.</p>

<p>The big problem I have with these exercises, however, is that they get fairly
challenging by the end.  I’m not sure how I would go about fitting the
verification of a DMA into an AXI formal verification course of only a couple
days–especially since it took me a couple of weeks to verify <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">my own
DMA</a>.
So … I’ll continue to keep my eyes open for better (simpler) examples to
work with and from.  Until then, this is still a really good list of exercises
for any student to work with in order to learn the basic AXI concepts on his or
her own.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I’m not sure I’ve seen a lot of good AXI training material on-line.  Most
of what I’ve seen, so far, has been Xilinx’s materials–and those materials
would have you start with and modify a
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">broken design</a>.
Further, there aren’t a lot of materials discussing how to <em>formally</em> verify
AXI designs, and it’s that formal part that was required in order to find some
really fundamental
bugs in Xilinx’s AXI designs.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I offer the roadmap above for learning AXI.  Not everyone
will need all of the lessons or exercises above.  However, the lessons and
exercises outlined above should be thorough enough for anyone to fully learn
the topic.</p>

<p>Finally, if a course in formally verifying AXI bus components is something you
would be interested in, then let me invite you to correspond with me and
express your interest.  Let me also invite anyone interested to suggest how
either the exercises might be simplified, or how the course might be
structured so as to make sure everyone has the time and ability to accomplish
each of the exercises.  Without such exercises, I fear that lecture alone would
leave students just as confused as they are or were when they entered
the course.</p>
