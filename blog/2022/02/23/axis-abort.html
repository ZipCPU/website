    <p>There, I said it.  One of the simplest and most useful AXI protocols,
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI Stream</a>, is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>Let’s quickly review AXI Stream, and then I’ll tell you what I mean by saying
the protocol is broken.  Then I’ll propose a method of fixing at least part
of the problem.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-axi-stream">What is AXI Stream?</h2>

<p>We’ve discussed <a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI Stream</a>s
a couple of times on this blog already, most recently when discussing the basic
<a href="/blog/2021/08/28/axi-rules.html">AXI handshaking rules</a>.
As a quick background, <a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI Stream</a>
is a protocol that can be useful for transferring <em>stream</em> data around within
a chip.  Unlike <em>memory</em> data, there’s no address associated with stream
data–it’s just a stream of information.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1. AXI stream signals</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/slave-rules/axis-signals.png" alt="" width="302" /></td></tr></table>

<p>But how fast shall the stream run?  As fast as it can be produced, or as
fast as it can be consumed?  This is determined by a pair of values:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID</code>, indicating that the data in the stream is valid on the current clock
cycle and produced by the source (master), and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TREADY</code>, indicating that
the consumer (slave) is prepared to accept data.  Whenever <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID </code>and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TREADY</code> are both true, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TDATA</code> moves through the stream.</p>

<p>A third signal is also very useful, and that is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code>.  The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code> signal
can be used to create <em>packets</em> of data, having beginning and ending.
The packet ends when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code> is true, and begins on the first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID</code> signal
following the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code> signal.</p>

<p>The stream standard also defines such signals as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TID</code> (an ID for a packet),
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TDEST</code> (the packet’s destination), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TSTRB</code> (which bytes have valid
information), and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TKEEP</code> (which bytes in a stream cannot be removed), but I
have personally only rarely seen uses for these.  The one exception is the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TUSER</code> field which comes nicely into play in video streams–but I digress.</p>

<p>There’s one other important term you need to know:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure"><em>backpressure</em></a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">Backpressure</a> is what’s created when
the source is ready to send data, that is when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID</code> is true, but the
consumer isn’t ready to receive it and so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TREADY</code> is false.  Under the
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI Stream</a> protocol, there’s no limit
to how much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">backpressure</a>
a slave may impose on any stream.</p>

<p>And herein lies my complaint.</p>

<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-axi-stream">What’s wrong with AXI Stream?</h2>

<p>There are three basic types of stream components, and realistically
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI Stream</a> only works for one of
these three.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2. AXI stream doesn't capture hard real-time requirements well</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/axis-abort/axis-pipeline.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sources</strong>.  Most of the physical data sources I’ve come across produce
data at a fixed and known rate.  Examples of these sources include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">Analog to Digital converters</a></li>
      <li>Network PHYs</li>
      <li>Digital cameras</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In all three of three of these examples, data comes whether you are ready
for it or not.  What then happens if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID</code> is true, from the source, but
the processing stream isn’t ready to handle it?  i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TREADY</code> is low?
Where does the data go?</p>

    <p>As an example, <a href="/dsp/dsp.html">some of the filters we’ve created on this
blog</a> can only accept one data sample every
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> samples (for some arbitrary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code>).  What happens if you choose to feed
the filter with data arriving at faster than one sample every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> clock
cycles?</p>

    <p>Let’s call this the <em>over-energetic source</em> problem for lack of a better
term, and it is a problem.  In general, there is no way to detect an
over-energetic source from within the protocol  As a result, there is no
protocol compliant way to handle this situation.  Given a sufficient amount
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">backpressure</a>,
data will simply be dropped in a non-protocol compliant fashion.  There’s
really no other choice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 25px"><caption>Fig 3. There are always real-time requirements</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/axis-abort/real-time.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    <p><strong>Processing components</strong>.  These are neither sources nor sinks, and in
today’s taxonomy, I shall arbitrarily declare that they have no real time
requirement.  In these cases, the
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI Stream</a> protocol can be a
really good fit.</p>

    <p>A good example of such processing components would include data processing
engines.  Perhaps some seismic data was recorded a couple of years ago
and you wish to process it in an FPGA today.  In this case, there’s may be
neither explicit latency nor throughput requirements.  The data stream can
move through the system as fast as the hardware algorithm will allow it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sinks</strong>.  Here you have the second problem: most sinks need to interact
with physical hardware at a known rate.  Corollaries to the examples above
form good examples here as well:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter">Digital to analog converters</a></li>
      <li>Network PHYs</li>
      <li>Video monitors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What happens in these cases if it’s time to produce a sample, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TREADY</code> is
true to accept that sample, but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID</code> is not?  That is, data is required
but there’s no data to be had?  We might call this the <em>sluggish source</em>
problem for the sake of a discussion, although the condition itself is
often called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_underrun">buffer
underrun</a>.</p>

    <p>As with the first situation, there’s really no protocol compliant way of
handling this situation.</p>

    <p>Unlike the first situation, however, a sink can often detect this situation
(!<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID &amp; READY</code>) and handle it in an application specific manner.  For
example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter">DAC</a>
might replicate the last output value and raise an error flag.  A network
PHY might simply terminate the packet early–without any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>, and so cause
the receiver to drop the packet.  A video stream might blank to black, and
then wait for the next frame to resynchronize.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>From this list, you can see that two of the three
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI Stream</a> component types can’t
handle the raw <a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI Stream</a> protocol
very well.  Of these two, the over-energetic source problem is the most
problematic.</p>

<p>There’s another, more minor, problem with
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI streams</a>, and that is the problem
of recording any metadata associated with the stream.  As an example, let’s
just consider the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code> signal.  What should an
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI streams</a>
processing system do with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code> signal when the data needs to be
recorded to memory?  In general, it’s just dropped.  In many cases, that
“just works”.  For example, if you are recording video, where every video
frame has the same length, then you should be able to tell what packet you are
on by where the write pointer is in memory.  On the other hand, if every
packet has a different size, then a different format is really needed.</p>

<p>These are the two problems I’ve come across when working with
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI streams</a> which I would like to
address today.</p>

<h2 id="motivating-a-solution">Motivating a Solution</h2>

<p>Just to motivate a solution a little bit, I’m currently working on building
a SONAR data capture design for a customer.  This particular design will be
for an underwater SONAR device, so physical access to the actual device will
be limited.  We’ve chosen instead to run all access over an Ethernet
connection.  On top of that, prior experience building designs like this has
generated some reluctance in the team I’m working with to have a design depend
upon a CPU.  They would rather have a design that “just works” as soon as power
is applied.</p>

<p>Fig. 4 shows a basic outline of this application, where data is collected from
a number of sensors, serialized, compressed, organized into packets, converted
to UDP, and then forwarded across a network data link.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4. A Basic network data collector</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/axis-abort/sonar-application.svg" alt="" width="640" /></td></tr></table>

<p>My <a href="/blog/2018/02/09/first-cyclonev.html">previous approach</a>
to network handling didn’t “just work” at the speeds I wanted to work at.  In
that case, the ARM CPU on the DE10-Nano couldn’t keep up with my data rate
requirements.  (Okay, <a href="/blog/2019/04/27/axi-addr.html">part of the fault was the
method I was using</a> to
transfer data to the CPU …)  Lesson learned?  Automated data processing,
and in particular network packet handling <em>that approaches the capacity of
the network link</em>, should be handled in the fabric, not in the CPU.</p>

<p>This meant that I needed to rearrange my approach to handling networks.
I needed something automatic, something that didn’t require a CPU, and
something that “just worked”.</p>

<p>I first looked at <a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI stream</a>,
and then came face to face with the problem above: what happens if the stream
is going to someplace where the buffer is full?  What happens if there’s too
much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">backpressure</a>
in the system to handle a new packet?  What happens when an output packet is
blocked by a collision with another outgoing packet, or when such a collision
takes so long to resolve that there’s no longer any buffer space to hold the
outgoing packet?</p>

<p>In network protocols, the typical answer to this problem is to drop packets.
Unfortunately, the <a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI stream</a>
protocol offers no native support for dropping packets.</p>

<p>Let’s fix that.</p>

<h2 id="proposing-a-solution-packet-aborts">Proposing a solution: Packet aborts</h2>

<p>At this point, I’m now well into the design of this system, and the solution
I chose was to add an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal to the
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI stream</a> protocol.  The basic
idea behind this signal is that an AXI master should be able to cancel any
ongoing packets if the slave generates too much
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">backpressure</a> (holds <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TREADY</code> low
too long).</p>

<p>Here are the basic rules to this new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> may be raised at any time–whether or not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TREADY</code> are
true.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> may also be raised for any cause.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">Backpressure</a>
is only one potential cause.  Why?  Think about it.  An <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal caused
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">backpressure</a> at one point in a
processing chain may need to propagate forward to other portions of the
chain that weren’t suffering
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">backpressure</a>.  In other
words, the protocol needs to allow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code>’s whether or not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">backpressure</a>
was currently present on a given link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following an abort, the next sample from the
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI stream</a>
will always be the first sample of the next packet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT &amp;&amp; !TVALID</code>, then the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> may be dropped immediately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT &amp;&amp; TVALID</code>, then the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal may not be dropped until
after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT &amp;&amp; TVALID &amp;&amp; TREADY</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID &amp;&amp; TREADY &amp;&amp; TLAST</code> have been received, the source can no
longer abort a packet.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal is very similar to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TUSER</code> signal, but with a couple
subtle differences.  First, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TUSER</code> is only valid if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID</code> is also true,
whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> may be raised at any time.  Second, an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal may be
raised <em>while</em> the channel is stalled with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID &amp;&amp; !TREADY</code>.  This
would be a protocol violation if a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TUSER</code> signal was used to carry an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code>
signal.</p>

<p>Still, that’s the basic protocol.  For lack of a better name, I’ve chosen to
call this the “AXI network” protocol or AXIN for short.</p>

<h2 id="the-drop-signal">The DROP signal</h2>

<p>I would be remiss if I didn’t mention
<a href="https://twitter.com/joshltyler">@JoshTyler</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/joshtyler/hdl_common/synth/axis/axis_packet_fifo.sv">prior
work</a>
before going any further.  <a href="https://twitter.com/joshltyler">@JoshTyler</a>
chose to use a DROP signal, similar to my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal proposed above.
Whenever his <a href="https://github.com/joshtyler/hdl_common/synth/axis/axis_packet_fifo.sv">Packet
FIFO</a>
encounters a DROP signal, it simply drops the entire packet–much like
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal I’ve proposed above would do.</p>

<p>There are a couple of subtle differences, however, between his DROP signal and
my proposed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal.  The biggest difference between the two is that, in
the AXIN protocol, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal may arrive without an accompanied
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID</code>.  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> may also be raised even if the stream is stalled with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TVALID &amp;&amp; !TREADY</code>.  From this standpoint, it’s more of an out of band signal
whereas <a href="https://twitter.com/joshltyler">@JoshTyler</a>’s DROP signal is in band.</p>

<p>Both approaches are designed to solve this problem, and both could work nicely
for this purpose.  In general, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshltyler">@JoshTyler</a>’s
approach looks like it was easier to implement.  However, it also looks like
<a href="https://github.com/joshtyler/hdl_common/synth/axis/axis_packet_fifo.sv">his implementation</a>
might hang if ever given a packet larger than the size of <a href="https://github.com/joshtyler/hdl_common/synth/axis/axis_packet_fifo.sv">his
FIFO</a>.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-success-does-it-work">Measuring success: does it work?</h2>

<p>Of course, the first question should always be, does my proposed AXIN
protocol work?  At this point in the development of my own design, I can
answer that with a resounding <em>yes!</em>  Not only does this technique work, it
works quite well.</p>

<p>Allow me to share some of my experiences working with this protocol, starting
from the beginning.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 5. First steps</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/axis-abort/first-steps.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<ol>
  <li>As with most of the protocols I’ve come to work with, my first step was to
build a set of formal properties to define the AXIN protocol.  These matched
the modified AXI stream properties outlined above.</li>
</ol>

<p>That was the easy part.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding=25px"><caption>Fig 6. The AXIN FIFO</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/axis-abort/netfifo.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    <p>The next piece I built was a basic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> enabled FIFO, shown in Fig. 6 on
the left.  This FIFO had two AXIN ports: an AXIN slave port and an AXIN
master port.  The simple goal of the FIFO was to provide some buffer room
between a packet source and a destination.</p>

    <p>Here I came across the first problem with the protocol: the FIFO turned out
to be a real challenge to build.  (<a href="https://github.com/joshtyler/hdl_common/synth/axis/axis_packet_fifo.sv">Josh’s
implementation</a>
looks easy in comparison.) What happens, for example, if two packets are in
a FIFO and the third packet aborts?  The first two packets, which now have
allocated memory within the FIFO must go through.  What happens if the FIFO
is completely full with less than a packet and the source aborts?  The FIFO
output must abort as well, and the FIFO should then flush the incoming
packet until its end–even though the source will know nothing of the packet
getting dropped.  All of these new conditions made this AXIN protocol a
challenge to build a design for.  Today, however, the task is now done and
the FIFO works.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once I had a FIFO in place, things started getting easier.  I then built an
AXIN payload to UDP converter, an AXIN multiplexer to select from multiple
packet sources, an AXIN broadcast element to broadcast packets to multiple
separate packet handlers, and more.  With each new component, the protocol
became easier and easier to use.</p>

<p>Two recent examples might help illustrate the utility of this approach.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, on startup, the network PHY is given a long reset.  (It might be
too long …)  During this time, however, packets are still generated–they
just need to be dropped internally because the network controller is holding
the PHY in reset.  Sure enough, the FIFO that I had put so much time and
energy into worked like a champ!  It dropped these packets, and recovered
immediately once the controller brought the PHY out of reset and started
accepting packets.  Even better, I haven’t found any bugs in it since the
formal verification work I went through.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second example I have is one of data packet generation.  As you may
recall, one of the primary design goals was to broadcasting data packets,
each containing an internal time stamp.  The problem is that this data packet
includes in its header a time stamp associated with the data–something not
known until the data is available.  In other words, the header cannot be
formed until the both the data and its associated time stamp are available.
Once that first data sample is available, though, the data must now wait for
the header to be formed and forwarded downstream.  The problem then replicates
itself again in the next processing stage: the payload to UDP packet
converter.</p>

    <p>My first approach to data packet generation was to try and schedule the
packet header generation between the time when the data entered the
data compression pipeline stage and when it came out to go into the payload
generator (See Fig. 4 above), but then I came across a simulation trace in
which the last data sample of one packet was immediately followed by the
first data sample of the next packet.  That left no time cycles for header
generation between the last data sample of the one packet and the first
sample of the next.  When I went back to the drawing board to look for another
solution, I found my AXIN FIFO.  Placing this FIFO between the data source
and the packet generator solved this problem nicely, and I haven’t had a
reason to look back since.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Indeed, the ease of building these subsequent data handling components has
easily repaid the time I have put into building the original FIFO a couple
times over.</p>

<p>No, this new protocol isn’t perfect.  I still needed a way to transition
from a packet that can be dropped to one that has been fully accepted.
In particular, I wanted to generate a DMA engine that could store a packet
into memory.  Indeed, this brings up the next problem: how shall packet
boundaries be preserved once the packet is stored in memory?</p>

<p>I’ve seen two solutions to this problem.  One solution is to record <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code>
along with the packet data, so the boundary can be rediscovered at a later
time.  This works, as long as you have room for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code> bit.  A second
solution I’ve found in a vendor design is to capture <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code> data in a
separate memory.  This works until you discover one memory becoming full
before the other one.  Indeed, I seem to recall a bug report having to do
with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code> buffer suffering from an overrun while the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TDATA</code> buffer
still had plenty of room in it …</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>Just as a quick reminder, most data buses have a power of two width.  That
means they are 8b, 16b, 32b, 64b, 128b, etc. wide.  At this width, there’s no
room for an extra bit of information to hold the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code> bit indicating the end
of a packet once it has been placed into memory.  I wanted another solution
to this problem therefore.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 7. Converting from AXIN to AXI Stream</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/axis-abort/pkt2stream.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <p>This leads to the third main component I built: A bridge from AXIN to a
proper <a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI stream</a> with no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code>.
I then embed into this stream, in the first 32’bit word of packet data, the
length of the packet in bytes.  Then, once converted to this format, basic
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI stream</a>
tasks become easy again, since I could now use regular
<a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI stream</a> components.  Similarly, I
could now write packets to memory and maintain the packet boundaries at the
same time.</p>

    <p>As with the FIFO, however, this component was a real challenge to build.
Just so we are clear, the challenge wasn’t so much the challenge of writing
Verilog to handle the task.  That part was easy.  The real challenge was
writing Verilog that would work under all conditions.  Sure enough, the formal
solver kept finding condition after condition that my AXIN to stream bridge
wasn’t handling properly.  For example, what should happen if the incoming
packet is longer than the slave’s packet buffer?  The slave should drop the
packet–not the master.  All of these and more had to go into this protocol
converter.</p>

    <p>One reality of my current version of the bridge, however, is that it limits
the size of a packet to what can be stored within the block RAM found within
the bridge.  Given time, I’ll probably remove this limitation by adding an
external memory interface–but that’s a project still to come.</p>

    <p>However, being able to capture a full packet in block RAM has the advantage
of guaranteeing that any locally generated packets can be guaranteed to be
complete packets before they are sent to the PHY.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once the whole packet processing chain was put together, it looked roughly
like Fig. 8 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 8. Network processing chain</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/axis-abort/net-stream-blocks.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>First, the packet would be formed by grouping raw data samples together with
a time stamp and a frame number.  In general, this involved a series of stages,
almost all with small FIFOs, as various headers were applied.  The result was
typically an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">Ethernet packet</a>
encapsulating an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IPv4 packet</a>
encapsulating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP
packet</a> with an
application specific payload.  This generated packet had the basic structure
shown in Fig. 9.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 25px"><caption>Fig 9. Final packet structure</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/axis-abort/datapacket.svg" alt="" width="180" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Going back to Fig. 8, this packet was then buffered, converted to
AXI stream proper (without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLAST</code>), and then sent through an
<a href="/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html">asynchronous FIFO</a>.  On the
other side of the FIFO, the packet was converted back to the AXIN
protocol, albeit with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal now held low, and a single packet
source was selected to feed the network controller.  Because every packet
source had its own buffer, and because the <a href="/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html">asynchronous
FIFO</a> operated on
32-bit data using a clock speed that was faster than one quarter the network
speed, there was never a chance that the network controller would run dry
prior between starting and completing a packet.</p>

<p>Further, in spite of all the resources used by this approach, the Artix
A7-200T I am using still has plenty of LUTs and LUT RAMs (over 80%+) remaining
for a lot more design work.</p>

<p>Perhaps the proverb that describes this work the best is, “In all labour
there is profit,” since my original work to generate the formal AXIN
properties, the following network FIFO, and then AXIN to stream converter,
has now all been repaid in spades via reuse.

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p><a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI stream</a> remains a simple and
easy to use protocol.  Indeed, it is ideal for any application where you can
guarantee your design will match any needed rates before using it.  Yes,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">backpressure</a> is a great feature,
but it is also important to recognize that all systems have a limit of how
much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">backpressure</a> they can handle
before breaking any real time requirements.  Once the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">backpressure</a> limit of any design
has been reached, some <a href="/doc/axi-stream.pdf">AXI stream</a>
sources may need to be able to control what happens next.  Others simply need
to be able to flag the existence of the data loss.  Either way, apart from
careful extra-protocol engineering and rate management, data loss becomes
inevitable.</p>

<p>So, just how should dropped data be handled in your application?</p>

<p>In the case of network packet data that I’ve been working with, the easy
answer is to drop a whole packet whenever on-chip packet congestion becomes too
much to deal with.  The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ABORT</code> signal has worked nicely for this purpose, in
spite of the initial challenges I had in working with it.</p>

<p>In many ways, this only pushes the problem up a level in the stack.
In my case, that’s okay:  Most network protocols are robust enough to be
able to handle some amount of packet loss.  Packet loss can be detected
via packet frame counters, time stamps or both.  Packet loss can also be
detected in client-server relationships whenever a reply to a given request is
not received in a timely manner.  In those cases, requests can be retried or
eventually abandoned.  This is all quite doable, and doing it in a controlled
manner is key to success.</p>

<p>Indeed, this technique has worked so well that I’ve started applying something
similar to video streams as well.  Have you noticed, for example, that many
video IPs are very sensitive to which IPs get reset first?  That, however, may
need to remain a topic for another day.</p>
