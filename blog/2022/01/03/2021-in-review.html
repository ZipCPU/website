    <p>In the spirit of looking back at the last year with every new year, shall
we take a look back at 2021?  No, let’s do better.  Last year, we never looked
back at 2020, so today let’s look back at both 2020 and 2021.  To do that,
let’s look up which articles have had the most page views, and then take a
look at what articles may be coming up in 2022.</p>

<p>But first, how’s the blog going?</p>

<h2 id="whats-going-on-with-the-blog">What’s going on with the blog?</h2>

<p>Well, first off, the blog is working.</p>

<p>“Working”?  What do I mean by that?</p>

<p>Well, <a href="/blog/2020/01/01/2019-in-review.html">as you may
remember</a>,
my goal with this blog has always been to attract customers to Gisselquist
Technology, LLC.  I’m a small shop, so I don’t need more than a small handful
of customers with just a couple of projects to keep me fully employed.  Those
who’ve wished to hire me haven’t had a problem finding my (not so well-hidden)
E-Mail and writing me directly for support.</p>

<p>So far, it’s worked.  I’ve been well employed.  Perhaps even over employed,
having more tasks than people to work on them.  Economically, this is a good
place to be in.</p>

<p>Second, the blog itself is no longer funded by a large sponsor.  That’s not a
big deal, until you realize that the time I put into the blog is no longer
funded.  It hasn’t made it into my work week this last year.  Instead, I’ve
kept the blog running on weekend or vacation hours this last year.  The sad
part of this is that the number of articles I’ve posted has gone down over
the years.</p>

<ul>
  <li>31 non-quiz posts in 2019</li>
  <li>25 non-quiz posts in 2020</li>
  <li>17 non-quiz posts in 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem I’m having, however, is that I have more work than resources.
Keep your eyes and ears peeled on this one.  You may discover that there’s
more than one of me by the end of the year.  We’ll see where the Lord leads
between now and then.</p>

<h2 id="top-posts-from-2020">Top Posts from 2020</h2>

<p>Before diving into the top ten posts from 2020, I should explain why this
list wasn’t posted last year at the new year.  The reason is simply
that the last month of 2020 was dominated by comments made by individuals
who wished to cancel the ZipCPU blog for statements I had made that they
disagreed with.</p>

<p>Specifically, <a href="/blog/2020/11/26/zipcpu-biz.html">I had commented
that</a>: “God made man
“male and female” by design.  This is obvious and evident from the creation
itself: Only women can give birth.  Only women menstruate.  Only women suffer
from miscarriages.  Men who dress like women, who call themselves women, are
nothing more than that: men who dress like women, and who imagine themselves
to be women.  Some may have even made themselves eunuchs.  They have not made
themselves into women.”  This was then my justification for refusing to use
female pronouns for a man.  You can read more of how <a href="/blog/2020/11/26/zipcpu-biz.html">this became a business
issue in the article</a>,
should you be interested.  It’s a sad story.</p>

<p>Needless to say, these comments caused quite an uproar on social media.</p>

<p>Despite the uproar caused by these comments, I see no reason to update, correct,
or change my comments above.  Of all those who have challenged these comments,
no one has challenged the truth of their content.  The closest anyone has come
to challenging the truth of these statements has been based on a “<a href="https://fallacyinlogic.com/straw-man-argument/">straw man
argument</a>”: This person asked
me if, by my measure, a woman who could not bear children was no longer
a woman.  Since that wasn’t what I had said, I see no reason to change
or apologize for these comments.</p>

<p>Instead, let me say that if these words offend you, then perhaps this blog
isn’t for you.  If you wish to stick around, then <a href="/blog/2021/07/25/healing.html">know that there is a
second half to the Gospel of Jesus, the
Christ</a>.</p>

<p>Because the end of the 2020 was dominated by the many who were offended, I
held off on sharing the top ten articles I had posted in 2020.  The following
Bible verses share some of my reasons for this:
<a href="https://blueletterbible.org/kjv/pro/15/28">[1]</a>,
<a href="https://blueletterbible.org/kjv/pro/26/4">[2]</a>,
<a href="https://blueletterbible.org/kjv/ecc/10/2">[3]</a></p>

<p>It’s now been a year and the furor has died down.  Those who are offended
by these comments no longer read the blog.  Indeed, I can even measure the
effect.  As a result of those who were offended by these comments, I lost about
200 twitter followers out of 4,200, or about 5%.  This particular incident
hasn’t really hurt me or the blog very much.  Indeed, I’m moving on–although
I may yet come back and address this issue again if need be.</p>

<p>With that as background, let’s go back and take a look at the top ten articles
from 2020 and give them the highlight they deserve based upon their total
page views across both 2020 and 2021.  Here are these top ten articles from
2020, from least to most popular:</p>

<ol start="10">
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2020/01/13/reuse.html">Lessons in Hardware Reuse</a>, 1,590 page views</p>

    <p>This is a fun article discussing reuse from a personal, business,
perspective.  I own all my IP, so I should be able to re-use it without
a problem, no?  Sadly, what should be a reuse panacea has had some pitfalls
within it that I never expected.  These surprises are discussed in this
article.</p>

    <p>This article gets a duckduckgo.com score of #1.  It is the top or first
hit, when searching duckduckgo.com for “hardware reuse.”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>It doesn’t really seem right to list a post about posts as a top article,
but the article, “<a href="/blog/2020/01/01/2019-in-review.html">2019: AXI Meets Formal
Verification</a>”, my
last end of year summary from two years ago now, received more page views
at 1,873 than the
<a href="/blog/2020/01/13/reuse.html">Reuse</a> article above.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="9">
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2020/10/03/tfrvalue.html">Moving values and strobes cross clock domains</a>, 2,154 page views</p>

    <p>This is one of several clock domain crossing articles that have been a
real hit.  The first one, <a href="/blog/2017/10/20/cdc.html">Some Simple Clock-Domain Crossing
Solutions</a>, discusses CDCs
in general.  Indeed, this article is a hit in its own right as you’ll see
below.  This article also discussed how to move multi-bit values across clock
domains while keeping them coherent.  Once I got heavily involved in formal
methods, though, I wanted
to start adding formal methods checks to asynchronuos logic.  I started,
therefore, with a simple article on <a href="/formal/2018/04/12/areset.html">Formally Verifying an Asynchronous
Reset</a>.  This didn’t
seem complete enough, so I tried another: <a href="/formal/2018/05/31/clkswitch.html">Formally Verifying Asynchronous
Components</a>.  This went
over the formal verification of a clock switch.  A fun project.  With these
few under my belt, I posted about <a href="/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html">Crossing clock domains with an
Asynchronous FIFO</a>–another
big hit as you’ll see below.  That’s about as good as you can get, no?</p>

    <p>Well, not quite.  There’s always a reason to want to transfer <em>values</em>,
not data, across clock domains.  The difference being that these values
don’t necessarily need to move at high speed, and there’s not necessarily
another one following the first.  It’s just that: a value that needs to
cross clock domains.</p>

    <p>That’s the focus of the article, but with one other twist: the approach
is twice as fast as the one I presented in <a href="/blog/2017/10/20/cdc.html">my first CDC
article</a>.
Feel free to check it out.</p>

    <p>This follows from a question I was handed regarding which tools I use.
Since writing the article, I’ve now done a lot more with
<a href="http://iverilog.icarus.com">iverilog</a> and even
<a href="https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/system-design-and-verification/simulation-and-testbench-verification/xcelium-simulator.html">XCellium</a> (a
commercial simulator).  Perhaps I may come back and discuss the main
differences between these simulation approaches and my preferred approach:
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>.</p>

    <p>While I tried, I was unable to get a valid duckduckgo.com score for this
article.</p>

find <a href="/dsp/dsp.html">more DSP articles on the DSP page</a>, if
you are interested, to include other filtering articles in this series.</p>

    <p><a href="/blog/2020/06/16/axiaddr-limits.html">The hard part of building a bursting AXI Master</a>, 3,632 page views</p>

    <p>What I’d really like to blog about is how to build one of these bursting
AXI masters.  I’m not really sure how to get from here to there though.
AXI-lite masters are fairly easy to build and verify.  AXI4 bursting masters?
Those that issue burst requests?  Much harder.  This article discusses why,
and some of the challenges I’ve had while trying to build and verify
such masters.</p>

    <p>Basically, the formal tool tends to get about 5-10 clock cycles into any
bursting master implementation before it starts finding bugs.  These are
usually associated with issuing the very first burst request of the bus.  I
then find myself spending a day or even two finding and fixing bugs at this
point.  It’s just a real challenge to get right.  (No, Xilinx didn’t get
their DMA right here either–it dies quickly at this point due to a detail
I doubt anyone would notice.)</p>

    <p>In all, verifying a bursting AXI master can take 3-4 days of work.  I’m not
yet certain how to turn that into an article that would explain to all
how to do it.  Until then, <a href="/blog/2020/06/16/axiaddr-limits.html">this
article</a> is
perhaps the best I have.  It attempts to go over the pitfalls, explain
why these masters are a challenge to build, and then to outline what I’ve
done to get around the various challenges involved.</p>

    <p>Not knowing a good search term, I not going to give this item a
duckduckgo.com score.</p>

    <p><a href="/blog/2020/11/26/zipcpu-biz.html">Is it possible to make a living as a solo digital design
engineer?</a> 3,995 page views</p>

    <p>This is the article that started the furor mentioned above.</p>

    <p>Yes, I can get anxious about where my next paycheck will come from.  Yes,
as a solo engineer, I worry about where the next job will come from.  There
are just too many things that I cannot control about my future.</p>

    <p>Bottom line: As a business man, I depend upon “gifts” from the Almighty.
Such “gifts” often come in the form of contracts.  Some come in the form
of new business contacts.  It’s for this reason that I judge it more
important to please God than to please men.  Therefore, don’t ask me to
lie or otherwise violate my faith.  I’d rather find another customer, than
to work with someone that requires that I lie.</p>

    <p>This item gets a duckduckgo.com score of #1, the top/first hit, when
searching for “solo digital design engineer”.  This is probably due more
to the attention a small section generated rather than the entirety of the
article, but so be it.

Use an AXI-lite slave to feed and recover the AXI stream.  It’s a simple
enough approach.  It’s also one of my first AXI stream articles.</p>

    <p>Not all of my blog articles are about digital design.  I chose, early on,
to also discuss faith and ethics but at a less frequent level.  This has
kept the ZipCPU blog and twitter feed from being aggregated with other
tech blogs that don’t have this “feature”.</p>

    <p>This article, regarding the faith of a mustard seed, presents a missing
viewpoint on Jesus’ teachings of mustard seeds.  It’s a completely
different take from the mainstream.  It turns Jesus teaching from an
impossibility into an encouragement.</p>

    <p>I’m honored that so many individuals have enjoyed this article.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised, but this article only gets a
duckduckgo.com score of #89 when searching for “faith of a
mustard seed”.  Sadly, most of the prior articles describe this faith as the
least of all faiths, since the size of the mustard seed is so small.  I
argue in the article that this is entirely the wrong way to understand the
parable, but you may have to read it to know more.</p>

    <p><a href="/blog/2020/03/08/easyaxil.html">Building an AXI-Lite slave the easy way</a>, 9,610 page views</p>

    <p>When <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">I first built my formal AXI-lite properties, I tested them on Xilinx’s
demonstration design</a>.
(They call it their AXI-lite “template.”)  I was
surprised to find it horribly broken.  Once you have a set of formal
properties, though, it becomes really easy to build your own design that
meets those properties.  That became the basis for <a href="/formal/2019/01/12/demoaxilite.html">my next post on the
topic of AXI-Lite</a>.</p>

    <p>The problem was that <a href="/formal/2019/01/12/demoaxilite.html">this first version of an AXI-Lite
slave</a> wasn’t very
easy to work with.</p>

    <p>Over time, as I got to working with AXI-Lite, I sort of settled on a simpler
skeleton design to start from.  I call it <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/easyaxil.v">my “easyaxil”
design</a>.  This
is the design I go to when I need a control port for any new interface.
It’s simple, and easy to work with.  <a href="/blog/2020/03/08/easyaxil.html">This

    <p><a href="/blog/2020/03/23/wbm2axisp.html">Building a basic AXI Master</a>, 12,219 page views</p>

    <p>This is the first post I’ve written regarding building an AXI master.  I’ve
since written others, but this remains a good, basic, startup guide for
building an AXI master.  Not only does it outline the basic templates for
the required AXI logic, but it also discusses the context in which an
AXI master will find itself, and a taxonomy of the various types of
AXI masters.</p>

    <p>The only drawback to this article is that the AXI master presented is really
a bridge.  Rather than some ethereal “AXI master”, this one bridges from
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a> to AXI.  Not
everyone uses
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>.
In hindsight, perhaps that’s not so bad: any bus master needs to accept
its direction from somewhere.  1) Both <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/18/wb-prefetch.html">CPU
fetch</a> and
<a href="/zipcpu/2021/04/17/axilops.html">memory units</a> need to
get their direction from the CPU.  2) A DMA needs to get its direction from
a control port.  3) My <a href="/blog/2021/12/30/dbgaxil.html">debugging bus
master</a> gets its direction
from a character stream.  Why should getting direction from a
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>
slave interface be a problem?</p>

    <p>Perhaps the only problem here is in the imagination of the reader, since all
of the principles are the same.</p>

    <p>The one thing this article doesn’t discuss is how to build an AXI master
that will generate burst requests.  I’ve discussed some of the problems
with presenting such a burst request generating master above.  On the other
hand, if you don’t need burst requests, this might just be ideal.</p>

<p>Let’s now turn our attention to the top ten posts, posted in 2021, as sorted
based upon their number of page views.  Since these articles are being judged
based upon a year, or less, they will (obviously) have fewer page views than
those of 2020 above.</p>

    <p><a href="/blog/2021/07/03/slowmpy.html">Building a Better Verilog Multiply for the ZipCPU</a>, 980 page views</p>

    <p>Many articles have been written about how to build a digital logic
multiply.  Many of these focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_tree">Wallace
trees</a> and some other amazing
implementations.  The reality is, though, that knowing how to build a
blazing fast multiplication algorithm on an FPGA is often irrelevant: FPGAs
have hardware multiplies you can use for that purpose.  Why slow down your
clock to create one of these faster multiplies?</p>

    <p>On the other hand, what if your goal is ultra-low logic, and you are working
on a device either with no hardware multiplies to work with, or perhaps no
hardware multiplies left?  <a href="/blog/2021/07/03/slowmpy.html">This
article</a>
focuses on just that situation within the

    <p>I’ve discussed above the struggles I’ve had trying to describe how to build

article very well.  <a href="/blog/2021/06/28/master-examples.html">This

your purpose from among the many listed?</p>

someone who was not able to get a working AXI4 master under HLS.  It’s

are not going to get AXI-anything to work if you mess up the handshaking.</p>

    <p>Indeed, I would strongly recommend that you learn the rules of the
AXI handshake before you write online asking for help.  That’s the
background of this article.  Indeed, there are some basic template logic
blocks offered in this article which, if you follow them, will guarantee
that you get the handshake right.  It’s not that hard to do, and I end up
naturally using those logic templates over and over again.  As a result,
this is a good article to read when you are having AXI problems–before
you go about embarrassing yourself.</p>

    <p>Clock gating on an FPGA is great when you want to emulate an ASIC design.
You’ll need special vendor primitives to do it.</p>

    <p>That’s not the topic of <a href="/blog/2021/10/26/clkgate.html">this
article</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="/blog/2021/10/26/clkgate.html">This article</a>
is instead about whether or not gating a clock would improve
<em>simulation</em> performance.  At first, it looked like the answer would be a
resounding yes.  So, I implemented a bunch of clock gates and then measured
everything.  In the end, it didn’t appear to improve Verilator performance
by any significant amount, but the experiment was pretty fun and I learned
a lot from it.  As a bonus, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> can now shut down its clock
when it’s either shut down or waiting for an interrupt.  Cool, no?</p>

    <p>Being able to know how well your AXI bus is running is a big deal.  Where
are your clock cycles going?  How fast are requests being made?  How long
does it take them to get from the processor to your slave?  Measurements are
always the first steps in any bus performance optimization effort.</p>

    <p>The problem is that AXI is … complicated.  It’s even worse in an
environment containing burst requests, multiple IDs, multiple masters, and
multiple slaves.  This article, therefore, attempts to distill the relevant
information from the AXI bus in order to create simplified AXI performance
measures you can use to know how fast your design is (or isn’t) running.</p>

    <p>I don’t normally do VHDL.  Sorry, but Verilog has now been my home since
about 2007 or so.  However, I currently have a copy of SymbiYosys that can be
used to verify VHDL designs, so why not try it out?  In this case, I used
Vivado to generate an AXI-lite design, and then ran SymbiYosys on it.  After
verifying that the basic Xilinx AXI-lite bugs were present, I then updated
the design until it passed a formal check.  Yes, there are only a small
number of updates required to get the design working, and I even get it
working well, but for some reason this post has been well loved in spite
of the minimal amount of work involved.</p>

    <p>How well does the design work in the end?  Well, without a
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffer</a>, the
best you can do is 50% throughput and this design doesn’t use a
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skid buffer</a>.
Still, the updated design hits 50% throughput number even though Xilinx’s
original write performance was 33% at best.  Indeed, once you either know
what you are doing, or rather once you can pretend with a formal tool
and an <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite property

far as to look for any forum request with the word “AXI” in its title.</p>

    <p>The fun result is that I got quite the survey of problems individuals were
struggling with when using AXI.  The post, therefore, is very informative.
It’ll tell you a lot about how others, both new and experienced, view AXI
and Xilinx’s AXI IP.</p>

    <p>There is a problem, however.  Since posting this article Xilinx has
completely revamped their community forums.  As a result, all my links to
the original forum posts are now lost.  I haven’t (yet) had the opportunity
to try to go back and look up the new links (Xilinx promises that they can
be found by searching for them anew), and Xilinx hasn’t shown any

    <p><strong>Me</strong>: Well, I have a design that hasn’t yet been tested.  Why not have him

his simulation capabilities, his Verilog capabilities, and even better

    <p><strong>Potential hiree</strong>: Sorry, I want a design job, not a verification job.</p>

Should the “top articles of 2021” be from the articles <em>written</em> in 2021, or
should it be from all of the articles <em>read</em> in 2021?  To make matters a touch
worse, the top ten articles <em>written</em> in 2021 tends to be biased towards
articles written earlier in the year, which have had time to accumulate more
page views.  The end result is an indecision that has lead me to post multiple

that–and figure out how many rounds are required for any given precision
at the same time.</p>

    <p>Perhaps that explains why <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic">this article</a>
is so interesting?  It’s the default standard for generating sine and cosine
waves within an FPGA.</p>

    <p>What’s not said is that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic">CORDICs</a>
can be very expensive logically if you want a lot of
precision.  I first learned this when building a brushless DC motor system
designed to run on an iCE40.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic">CORDICs</a>
took the majority of the design.
Just because they don’t use multiplies, doesn’t mean they don’t use logic.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I might come back to this topic again this year, and present
something that works better?  What works better?  Well, with just one or
two multiplies, you can turn a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/quadtbl.v">table lookup followed by an interpolator
into an awesome sinewave
generator</a>
that’ll easily best a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic">CORDIC</a>

article on some other topic.  Otherwise, here are some of the articles that
may (or may not) be completed this upcoming year <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15/">if the Lord is
willing</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cubic splines, and the Mother Spline</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/interpolation/issues/1">Lots of people think cubic spline interpolation is the end all of
interpolation, and if they could just get cubic spline interpolation working
on an FPGA they’d have it
made</a>.</p>

    <p>My current cubic spline (draft) article presents how to generate a cubic
spline interpolator for an FPGA.  The solution is somewhat unique, in that
the data set is <a href="https://zipcpu.com/dsp/2018/01/16/interpolation-is-convolution.html">assumed to be infinite</a>,
and the matrix solution required for the interpolation is done off-line in a
data independent fashion.  This generates the “Mother Spline” in the title.
This “Mother Spline” then makes it possible to implement a cubic spline via a
<a href="/dsp/2018/05/17/slowsymf.html">small convolution</a>
(FIR) applied to the original data set, followed by a second convolution with
a known piecewise cubic polynomial–such as <a href="https://zipcpu.com/dsp/2018/01/16/interpolation-is-convolution.html">we’ve already discussed on the
blog</a>.
Even better, because the majority of the spline solution is handled off line,
the resulting solution can easily be applied to any infinite data set–such
as an ongoing audio or radio frequency source.  Sadly, the solution itself
is not exact.  Perhaps that’s not so bad, though, since the solution can be
made arbitrarily close to a true cubic spline by whatever delta your
implementation requires.  In other words, it’s be good enough for
<em>engineering</em> work, although perhaps not good enough for the mathematicians.</p>

    <p>I’ve now worked on and off on this article off for months.  So far, it’s only
slowed down the eventual postings of other articles.  I’d still like to
finish it, though.  The last steps will be to figure out how to explain how
to generate the FIR, and then how to implement the necessary piecewise cubic.
Once done, this should be a nice contribution to the topic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RAW SPI Slave</p>

    <p>This is a much simpler article than the cubic spline article.</p>

    <p>This article is based around an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbspi/blob/master/rtl/rawslave.v">SPI slave
implementation</a>
that already exists, has already been built, and already passes a formal test.
That should make it easier to finish.  The key feature of
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbspi/blob/master/rtl/rawslave.v">this SPI slave</a>
is that it uses the SPI clock for most of its work.  Well, why not?  One of
the big criticisms I received from my article, <a href="/blog/2017/08/21/rules-for-newbies.html">Rules for new FPGA
designers</a>, was
my recommendation that everything should use one clock, and the example
the critic provided that violated this rule was an SPI slave.  He argued
that SPI slaves should use the SPI clock for their work.  So, I decided
to see how hard the task might be.</p>

    <p>As it turns out, doing this right is much harder than it looks.  Not only
that, but I wouldn’t have realized there were any problems were it
not for the formal proof.  <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15/">Lord
willing</a>, this article,
when finished, will clearly outline these pitfalls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“It’s not my fault!”</p>

    <p>One of the sad realities of posting open source designs is that people will
try to use them and fail–not because of any problem within the open source
design itself, but rather because of a bug within their own design.  This
seems to be quite common.</p>

    <p>This presents a bit of an economic headache for the open source designer, a
headache which forms the topic of this article.  The problem is that the
open source design and its maintenance are “paid for” (somehow), but
finding and fixing bugs in user designs that use the open source design
are not.</p>

    <p>This article tells the story of one such interaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steps to design checkoff</p>

    <p>This article focuses on a common tension between engineering and management.
When will the design be complete?  Management wants a schedule.  A typical
engineer’s response, however, is “When it’s complete” or perhaps, “I’m
working on it.”  Both of these are totally unacceptable to management.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15/">Lord willing</a>,
this article will present a formal verification based road map to a
solution to this problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New FIFO</p>

    <p>I mentioned above that I need to rewrite my synchronous FIFO article, so
here’s a place holder for that rewrite.
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15/">Lord willing</a>, this rewrite
will include such things as how to create a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/sfifo.v">synchronous
FIFO</a> from either
distributed or block RAM–with the key difference being that block RAM
requires a clock to read from memory into a register, such as an iCE40
requires, before the result can be used.  I’d also like to discuss building
a FIFO where you can write to it when full (and reading), and where you can
read from it when empty (and also writing).</p>

    <p>In other words, it’d be nice to create a full featured
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/sfifo.v">FIFO</a> article.</p>

    <p>Sadly, this one needs a lot of work.  It’s a long way from completion, so it
might take some time to get there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>M-Band filters</p>

    <p>One of the challenges of digital filter design is how to modify a well
designed filter in real time.  Often, the big problem of modifying the
filter is the FFT implementation the filter lies within.  The filter has
been tuned so that it can be implemented between an FFT/IFFT pair.  Any
changes to the filter in this space can cause it to violate the circular
convolution properties the filter was built with.</p>

    <p>M-Band filters offer a way of getting around this problem, forming the
topic of this article.</p>

    <p>Vivado Review</p>

    <p>Some time ago, <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1407778273430544385.html">I reviewed Xilinx’s release of Vivado
2021.1</a>.
Specifically, I examined several known “bugs” that had existed in Vivado
based IP for years, to see if Xilinx had fixed any of those bugs.  Sadly,
<a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1407778273430544385.html">the review</a>
was done on twitter and the graphics necessary to support it are now long
gone from the link above.</p>

    <p>I’m likely to repeat this review sometime again in 2022, to see what bugs
they’ve fixed.  Sadly, this means I’m going to have to download another
51GB+, and possibly break several of my own designs (always a risk on any
upgrade), so I’m not very eager to do this.  We’ll see what happens.</p>

    <p>This work will almost certainly wait for Xilinx to fix Vivado’s Y2022 bug.
That looks like it’s going to impact a large number of users.  We’ll see
how they handle it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Software Engineer who wants to build his own soft-core CPU on an FPGA</p>

    <p>Yeah, I know, everyone wants to build their own soft-core.  It’s a fun
project, even though an older hand will often wonder just how many times
its worth rebuilding the wheel.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15/">Lord willing</a>, this
particular article will offer some encouraging and thought provoking
words to anyone in this situation.  It’s mostly written, so we’ll see
where it goes and whether or not I complete it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Software vs Hardware, where to draw the line?</p>

    <p>This is a topic based on some conversations I’m having locally.  It’s been
quite thought provoking one for me.  A friend is pointing out to me that
I’ve now gotten to the point where I’ve started looking at the world like
a hammer, viewing every problem as a nail.  In my world, that means that every
digital logic problem is something to be solved in hardware / Verilog.</p>

    <p>The reality is that there needs to be a dividing line, somewhere where it
makes more sense to do some things in software and others in hardware.
Where is this dividing line?  That would be the topic of this article.</p>

    <p>AXI4 slave exclusive access</p>

    <p>Back in April of this year, I figured out how to modify my AXI property set
to handle exclusive access.  I learned a lot in the process.  I’ve since
tested the exclusive access properties on several design components.  One in
particular, the AXI4 slave I presented on the blog, is easily modified for
exclusive access.</p>

    <p>Given that there really aren’t any other examples of exclusive access
handling that I can find on the web, this might be a unique one once shared.
It’s actually worse than that, since many of the AXI interconnects you’ll
find on the web break exclusive access–but that’s another story that may,
or may not, make it into this article.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beating CORDIC with just two DSPs</p>

    <p>I mentioned above that I have a sine wave generator that requires just
two DSP elements.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/rtl/quadtbl.v">logic for this generator is
posted</a>, although
I haven’t mentioned it much on the blog.  It’s a curious design, though,
in this respect: it’s really easy to generate the table in such a manner
that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/cordic/blob/master/bench/cpp/quadtbl_tb.cpp">my test
bench</a>
doesn’t have sufficient capability to verify it.  The sine wave distortions
simply require an FFT too big than I can implement.  The good news is that
the two DSP’s used by this algorithm, should your device have them, often
render the logic usage much less than a similar
<a href="/dsp/2017/08/30/cordic.html">CORDIC</a>.
Even better, you don’t have the scale issue associated with the
<a href="/dsp/2017/08/30/cordic.html">CORDIC</a> when using this
sine wave implementation.</p>

    <p>Not bad, huh?</p>

    <p>The algorithm is built around <a href="/dsp/2018/03/30/quadratic.html">previous article(s) I’ve written on
interpolation</a>, so there’s
nothing really new here, save the awesomeness of the performance of this
technique.  Well, a good explanation of what’s going on will probably still
go a long ways as well.</p>

    <p>I just need to write it up.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While not directly related to the blog, I would like to cut a new release
of the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> this year.  The new
release speeds up the debugging interface, and adds (optional) clock gating
and bus independence with support for both
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>,
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-Lite</a>, and AXI4 buses.
Since the debug interface gets fundamentally changed by this release, this will
necessitate a major version update.  The good news is that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/tree/zipcore">the logic for this
release is complete</a>.  It’s been
tested, and it works.  The bad news is that the documentation has fallen a
touch behind.  Updating this documentation, and then releasing a new version
will be my next <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> task.</p>

<p>I guess the bottom line is that both the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> and the
<a href="">ZipCPU blog</a> are alive and well.  There’s still future in
both of them, and I’m still going.  Indeed, Gisselquist Technology is now
going stronger than I thought I ever would be–Thanks be to God for His
blessings and “gifts”.</p>
