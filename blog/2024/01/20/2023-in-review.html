    <p>It should come as no surprise that a blog with <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/08/01/advertising.html">no
advertisements</a> has never
paid my bills–at least not directly.  I blog for fun, and to some extent for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging</a>.
As I learn new concepts, I enjoy sharing them here.  Going through the rigor
to write about a topic also helps to make sure I understand the topic as well.</p>

<p>Why are there <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/08/01/advertising.html">no
advertisements</a>?  For
two reasons.  First, because I’m not doing this to make money.  Second, because
because I want more control over any advertising from this site than
most advertisers want to provide.  Perhaps some day the site will be supported
by advertising.  Until then, the web site works fine without advertisements.</p>

<p>So how then does the blog fit into my business model?  Simply because the blog
helps me find customers via those who read articles here and write to me.</p>

<h2 id="business-projects">Business Projects</h2>

<p>So, if the blog doesn’t pay my bills, then what does?</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>2023 Projects</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/2023-review/2023-funding.svg" width="320" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Well, six projects have paid the bills this year.  Three of these have been
ASIC projects, to include the <a href="https://www.arasan.com/product/xspi-psram-master/">PSRAM/NOR flash
controller</a>, and an <a href="https://www.arasan.com/product/onfi-4-2-controller-phy/">ONFI
NAND flash controller</a>.
Three other projects this year have been FPGA projects, to include an <a href="/blog/2023/11/25/eth10g.html">open
source 10Gb Ethernet switch</a>
and a SONAR front end based upon my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/videozip">VideoZip</a> design–after including several
very significant upgrades, such as handling ARP and ICMP requests in hardware.
That’s four of the six projects from this year.  Once the other two projects
become a bit more marketable, I may mention them here as well.</p>

<p>Since I’ve already discussed the <a href="/blog/2023/11/25/eth10g.html">10Gb Ethernet
design</a>, let me take a moment
and discuss the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">I2C controller</a></strong> within it.
The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">I2C controller</a> was originally designed
to support the SONAR project.  Perhaps you may remember the <a href="/blog/2021/11/15/ultimate-i2c.html">initial article,
outlining the design goals for this
controller</a>.  Thankfully,
it’s met all of these goals and more–but we’ll get to that in a moment.  As
part of the SONAR project, its purpose was to sample various non-acoustic
telemetry data: temperature, power supply voltage, current usage, humidity
within the enclosure, and more.  All of these needed to be sampled at regular
intervals.  At first glance, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/13ti5zx/when_do_you_solve_a_problem_in_software_instead/">this sounds like a software
task</a>–that
is until you start adding real-time requirements to it such as the need to
shut down the SONAR transmitter if it starts overheating, or using so much
power that the FPGA itself will brown out shortly.  So, the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">I2C controller</a> was designed to generate
(AXI stream) data packets automatically, without CPU intervention, which could
then be forwarded … somewhere.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 25px"><caption>An example I2C-driven OLED output</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/2023-review/ssdlogo-demo.jpg" width="260" /></td></tr></table>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">This design</a> was then incorporated into the
<a href="/blog/2023/11/25/eth10g.html">10Gb Ethernet design</a>.  There
it provided the team the ability to 1) read the DDR3 memory stick
configuration–useful for making sure the <a href="https://github.com/AngeloJacobo/DDR3_Controller">DDR3
controller</a> was properly
configured, 2) read the SFP+ configuration–and discover that we were using
1GbE SFP+ connectors initially instead of 10GbE connectors (Oops!), 3) read the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data">Extended Display Identification Data
(EDID)</a>
from the downstream <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI</a>
monitor, 4) configure and verify the <a href="https://www.skyworksinc.com/-/media/Skyworks/SL/documents/public/data-sheets/Si5324.pdf">Si5324</a>’s register
settings, 5) draw a logo onto a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Teyleten-Robot-Display-SSD1306-Raspberry/dp/B08ZY4YBHL/">small OLED display</a>,
all in addition to 6) actively monitoring hardware temperature.</p>

<p>Supporting these additional tasks required two fundamental changes to the
<a href="/blog/2021/11/15/ultimate-i2c.html">initial vision for this I2C
controller</a>.  First, I
needed an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/eth10g/blob/master/rtl/wbi2c/wbi2cdma.v">I2C
DMA</a>, to
quietly transfer results read from the device to memory.  Only once I had
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/eth10g/blob/master/rtl/wbi2c/wbi2cdma.v">this DMA</a>
could the CPU then inspect and/or report on the results.  (It was probably one
of the easiest DMA’s I’ve written, since <a href="/blog/2021/11/15/ultimate-i2c.html">I2C is a rather slow
protocol</a>.)
Second, each packet needed a designated <em>destination</em> channel, so the design
could know where to forward the results.  This was useful for knowing if the
I2C information should be forwarded to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/eth10g/blob/master/rtl/wbi2c/wbi2cdma.v">the
DMA</a>, for
storing in memory, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">HDMI</a>
slave controller, for forwarding the downstream monitor’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data">EDID</a>
to the upstream monitor.  The fact that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">this
controller</a>, designed for completely separate
project, in a completely different domain (i.e. SONAR), ended up working so
well in an <a href="/blog/2023/11/25/eth10g.html">10Gb Ethernet
design</a> project
is a basic testament to a well designed interface.</p>

<p>The year has also included some internally funded projects.  These include
a new <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDIO/eMMC controller</a>, a (to-be-posted)
upgrade to <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">my standard debugging
bus</a>, and a
<a href="/zipcpu/2023/05/29/zipcpu-3p0.html">ZipCPU upgrade</a>.  Allow
me to take a moment to discuss these three (unfunded) projects in a bit more
detail.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDIO/eMMC controller</a></strong> is new.  By
using all four data lanes and a higher clock rate, this upgrade offers a
minimum 8x transfer rate performance improvement over my prior SPI-only
version.  That’s kind of exciting.  Even better, the IP has been tested on
both an SD card as well as an <a href="http://www.skyhighmemory.com/download/eMMC_4GB_SML_PKG_S40FC004_002_01112.pdf">eMMC
chip</a>
as part of the <a href="/blog/2023/11/25/eth10g.html">KlusterLab (i.e. 10Gb Ethernet
board)</a> design.  The IP, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi/tree/master/sw">plus
software</a>, is so awesome I’m
likely to add it to any future designs I have with SD cards or eMMC chips in
the future.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>The difference between SPI and SDIO: Speed</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/2023-review/sdiovspi.svg" width="640" /></td></tr></table>

<p>That’s just the beginning, too.  Just because <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">this new SDIO
controller</a> works on hardware, doesn’t mean
it works in all modes.  Since its original posting, I’ve added verification to
support all the modes our hardware doesn’t (yet) support.  I’ve also started
adding eMMC BOOT mode support, and I expect I’ll be (eventually) adding DMA
support to this IP as well.  My goal is also to make sure I can support
multiple sector read or write commands–something the SPI only version couldn’t
support, and something that’s supposed to be supported in this new version but
isn’t tested (yet).  (Remember, <a href="/zipcpu/2022/07/04/zipsim.html">if it’s not tested it doesn’t
work</a>.)  In other
words, despite declaring this IP as “working”, it remains under very active
development.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>I will use Slave/Master Terms where appropriate</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/2023-review/slave.svg" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<!-- (COMSONICS, SoundWire) -->

<p>Then there’s the upgrade to the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">debuging
bus</a></strong>.  This has been in the works now for
quite a while.  My current/best debugging bus implementation
uses six printable characters to transmit a control code (read request, write
data, or new address) plus 32-bits of data.  At six data bits per 8-bit
character transmitted, this meant six characters would need to be sent
(minimum) in order to send either a 32-bit address or 32-bit data word,
leading to a 36b internal word.  It also required <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10*6</code> baud periods (10 baud
periods times six characters) for every uncompressed 32b of data transferred,
for a best case efficiency of 53%.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>The debugging bus multiplexes console and bus channels</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/2023-review/dbgbus.svg" width="640" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Since then, I’ve slowly been working on an upgrade to this protocol that will
use five (not necessarily printable) characters to transmit 32-bits of data
plus a control code.  This upgrade should achieve an overall 64% worst case
(i.e.  uncompressed) efficiency, for a speed improvement of about 16% over the
prior controller in worst case conditions.  The upgrade comes with some
synchronization challenges, but currently passes all of its simulation
checks–so at this point it’s ready for hardware testing.  My only problem
is … this upgrade isn’t paid for.  Inserting it into one of my business
projects is likely to increase the cost of that project–both in terms of
integration time as well as verification while chasing down any new bugs
introduced by this new implementation–at least until the upgraded bus is
verified.  This has kept this debugging bus upgrade at a lower priority to the
other paying projects.  Well, that and the fact that I only expect a 16%
improvement over the prior implementation.  As a result, the upgrade isn’t
likely to pay for itself for a long time.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Moving from 6 characters to 5 characters to send 32bits</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/2023-review/exbus.svg" width="640" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Finally, let’s discuss the <a href="/zipcpu/2023/05/29/zipcpu-3p0.html">ZipCPU’s big
upgrades</a>.  As with the
other upgrades, these were also internally funded.  However, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> has now formed a backdrop to a
majority of my projects.  Indeed, it’s <a href="/zipcpu/2021/07/23/cpusim.html">helped me verify ASIC IP in both
simulation</a> and FPGA
contexts.  One upgrade in particular will keep on giving, and that is the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/tree/master/rtl/zipdma">new DMA
controller</a>.  I’ve
already managed to integrate it into a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbsata">(work in progress) SATA
controller</a>, and I’m likely to retarget this
DMA engine (plus a small state machine) to meet the DMA needs of my new
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDIO/eMMC controller</a>.  Indeed, it is so
versatile that I’m likely to use this controller across a lot of projects.
Better yet, at this rate, I’m likely to build an AXI version of this new DMA
supporting all of these features as well.  It’s just that good.</p>

<p>As for dollars?  Well, let’s put it this way: the year is now over, and I’m
still in business.  Not only that, but I’ve also managed to keep two kids in
college this year.  More specifically, I expect my third child to graduate
from college this year.  (Five to go …)  So, I’ve been hanging in there,
and I thank my God that my bills have been paid.</p>

<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>

<p>2023 has been a slower year for articles than past years.  Much of this is due
to the fact that my time has been so well spent on other paying projects.
That’s left less time for blogging.  (No, it doesn’t help that my family
has fallen in love with Football, and that my major blogging times have been
spent watching my son’s high school games, Air Force Academy Falcon’s football,
the Kansas City Chiefs, Miami Dolphins, Philadelphia Eagles, and my own home
team–the disappointing Minnesota Vikings.) Still, I have managed to push out
seven new articles this year.  Let’s look at each, and see how easy they can
be found using DuckDuckGo.</p>

    <p><a href="/blog/2023/02/13/eccdbg.html">Debugging the hard stuff</a></p>

    <p>This article discusses some of the challenges I went through when debugging
modifications I made to a working ECC algorithm.  ECC, of course, is one of
those “hard” problems to debug since the intermediate data tends to look
meaningless when viewed.</p>

    <p><strong>DuckDuckGo Ranking:</strong> A search for “FPGA ECC Debugging” brings up the
<a href="">ZipCPU home page</a> as return #111.</p>

    <p>That’s kind of disappointing.  Let’s try a search using Google.  Google
finds <a href="/blog/2023/02/13/eccdbg.html">the correct page</a>
immediately as its #1 result.  At first I thought the difference was because
Google knew I was interested in <a href="">ZipCPU</a> results.  Then
I asked my daughter to repeat my test on her phone in private mode.  (She
has no interest in FPGA anything, so this would be a first for her.)  Her
Google ranking came up identical, so maybe I can trust this Google ranking.</p>

<p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> was originally designed
  to be a System within a Chip, or a SwiC as I called it.  This article
  discusses what a SwiC is, and tries to answer the question of whether or not
  a SwiC makes sense, or equivalently whether or not the
  <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> made for a good SwiC in the
  first place.  In many ways, this article was a review of whether or not the
  <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s
  design goals were appropriate, and whether or not they’ve been met.</p>

<p><strong>DuckDuckGo Ranking:</strong> Searches on SwiC return all kinds of
  irrelevant results, and searches on “System within a Chip” return all kinds
  of results for “Systems on a Chip”.  If you cheat and search for “ZipCPU
  SwiC”, you get the <a href="">ZipCPU</a> web site as the #1 page.</p>

    <p>A virtual FIFO is a first-in, first-out data structure built in hardware, but
using <em>external</em> memory–such as a DDR3 SDRAM–for its memory.  A virtual
packet FIFO is a virtual FIFO that guarantees completed packets and packet
boundaries, in spite of any back pressure that might otherwise cause the FIFO
to fill or overflow.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2023/04/08/vpktfifo.html">This article</a>
  goes over the why’s and how’s of a virtual packet FIFO: why you
  might need it, how to use it, and how it works.</p>

<p>Since writing this article, I’ve now built and tested a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/eth10g/blob/master/rtl/net/pktvfifo.v">Wishbone based
  virtual packet FIFO as part of the 10Gb Ethernet
  project</a>.
  Conclusion?  First, verifying the FIFO is a pain.  Second, I might be able to
  tune its memory usage with some better buffering.  But, overall, the FIFO
  itself works quite nicely in all kinds of environments.</p>

<p><strong>DuckDuckGo ranking:</strong>  The <a href="">ZipCPU blog</a> comes up as
  the #2 ranking on DuckDuckGo following a search for “Virtual Packet FIFO”.
  The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZipCPU">ZipCPU reddit page</a> comes up as the #7
  ranking.  The page itself?  Not listed.  However, both of the prior pages
  point to this article, so I’m going to give this a DuckDuckGo ranking of #2.
  Sadly, most of DuckDuckGo’s other results are completely irrelevant to a
  Virtual Packet FIFO.  In general, they’re about Virtual FIFOs–not
  Virtual <em>Packet</em> FIFOs.  As before, though, Google gets the right article
  as it’s number one search result.</p>

    <p>I haven’t written a lot about either Verilog test benches, or how to build
them, so this is a bit of a new topic for me.  Specifically, the question
involved was how to make your test bench generate properly synchronous

verifying my designs.  In the case of the new <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDIO/eMMC

before either the formal verification or the full simulation model were
complete.  This leaves open the question, how many bugs were missed by my

whether formal or simulation, is so important.</p>

    <p><strong>DuckDuckGo Ranking:</strong> A search for “SDIO formal verification” turns up the

fine on a Google ranking, and 2) DuckDuckGo’s search engine needs work.  <a href="/blog/2022/11/12/honesty.html">If
you want to sell me web-based services and don’t know

done your homework and leave your email in my spam box.</p>

<h2 id="upcoming-projects">Upcoming Projects</h2>

<p>So, what’s next for 2024?  Here are some of the things I know of.  Some of
these are paid for, others still need funding.</p>

<table align="center" style="float:none"><caption>2024 Projects</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/2023-review/2024-funding.svg" width="640" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Still, this is a good list to start from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>One of my ASIC projects is in the middle of a massive speed upgrade.  This is
not a clock upgrade, or a fastest supported frequency upgrade, but rather an
upgrade to adjust the internal state machine.  I’m anticipating an additional
speed up of between 8x and 256x as a result of this upgrade.</p>

    <p>Status?  <strong>Funded.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My brand new <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDIO/eMMC controller</a>
has neither eMMC boot support, nor DMA support.  Boot support might allow me
to boot the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> directly from
an eMMC card, whereas DMA support would allow the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
to read lots of data from the card without CPU interaction.
Both may be on the near-term horizon, although neither upgrade is funded.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 25px"><caption>Laptop projects have additional requirements</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/2023-review/laptop.svg" width="320" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Status?  Not funded.  On the other hand, this project fits quite nicely on
  my laptop for those days when I have the opportunity to take my son to his
  basketball practice … (He’s a 6’4” high school freshman, who is new to
  the sport as of this year …)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/AutoFPGA">AutoFPGA</a> is now, and has for some time,
been a backbone of any of my designs.  I use it for everything.  It makes
adding and removing IP components easy.  One of its key capabilities is
<a href="/zipcpu/2019/09/03/address-assignment.html">address assignment (and adjustment)</a>.
Sadly, it’s worked so well that it now needs some maintenance.  Specifically,
I’d like to upgrade it so that it can handle partially fixed addressing, such
as when some addresses are given and fixed while others are allowed to change
from one design to the next.  This is only a precursor, though, to supporting
2GB memories where the memory address range overlaps one of the ZipSystem’s
fixed address ranges.</p>

    <p>Status?  A <strong>funded</strong> (SONAR) project requires these upgrades.  Unlike my
current SONAR project, built around <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/">Digilent’s Nexys Video
board</a>,
this one will be built around <a href="https://www.enclustra.com/en/products/fpga-modules/mercury-kx2/">Enclustra’s Mercury
KX2</a>, and
so either <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/AutoFPGA">AutoFPGA</a> gets upgraded or
I can’t use the full memory range.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s GCC backend urgently
needs a fix.  Specifically, it has a problem with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail (sibling)
calls</a> that jump to register
addresses.  This problem was revealed when testing the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDIO/eMMC software
drivers</a>, and needs a proper fix before I
can make any more progress on upgrading the
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/zipcpu/2021/03/18/zipos.html">ZipOS</a>.</p>

    <p>Did I mention working on the
<a href="https://zipcpu.com/zipcpu/2021/03/18/zipos.html">ZipOS</a>?  Indeed.
realistically, further work on the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDIO/eMMC
software</a> really wants a proper OS of some
type, so … this may be a future and upcoming task.</p>

    <p>Status?  This project isn’t likely to get any funding, but other projects
are likely to require this fix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As another potential project, an old friend is looking into building a
“see-in-the-dark” capability–kind of like a “better” version of
night-vision goggles.  He’s currently arranging for funding, and after all of
my video work I might finally find a customer for it.  Yes, his work will
require some secret sauce processing–but it’s all quite doable, and could
easily fit nicely into this years upcoming work.</p>

    <p>Status?  If this moves forward, it will be <strong>funded</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’d also like to continue my work on a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbsata">Wishbone controlled SATA
controller</a> this year.  I started working
on this controller under the assumption that it would be required by my
SONAR project, and so funded.  Now it no longer looks like it will be funded
under this vehicle.  Still, the controller is now written, even though the
verification work is far from complete.  Specifically, I’ll need to work on
my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbsata">SATA (Verilog) Verification IP</a>, until
it’s sufficient enough to get me past knowing if I have the Xilinx GTX
transceivers modeled correctly or not.  Once I get that far, I can both
start testing against actual hardware (on my desk), as well as against
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
models.</p>

    <p>Status?  Funding has been applied for.  Sadly, it’s not likely to be enough
to pay for my hours, but perhaps I can have a junior engineer work on this.
Still, whether or not the funding comes through remains to be determined.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did I mention that the new debugging bus upgrades are on my list to be
tested?  Who knows, I may test their AXI counterparts first, or I may test
the UDP version first, or …  Only the Good Lord knows how this task will
move forward.</p>

    <p>Status?  Not funded at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am looking into getting some funding for a second version of an Ethernet
based Memory controller.  The SONAR project required a <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2022/08/24/protocol-design.html">first version of this
controller</a>,
and it smokes <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">my serial port based debugging
controller</a>.  A
second version of this controller, designed for resource constrained FPGAs,
designed for speed, designed for throughput from the ground up … could
easily become a highly desired product.</p>

    <p>We’ll see.</p>

    <p>Status?  Sounds fun, but not (yet) funded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I have an outstanding task to test an open source memory controller,
using an open source synthesis, and place and route tool, for both Artix-7
and Kintex-7 devices.  I’ll let you know how that works out.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since these are business predictions about the future, I am required by the
Good Lord to add that these are subject to whether or not I live and the
Lord wills.  (See <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jam/4/13-15">James
4:13-15</a> for an explanation.)</p>

<p>As always, let me know if you are interested in any of these projects, and
especially let me know if you are interested in funding one or more of them.
Either way, the upcoming year looks like it will be quite busy and it’s only
January.</p>

<p>“My cup runneth over (<a href="https://blueletterbible.org/kjv/psa/23/5">Ps 23:5</a>)”, and
so I shall also pray that God grants you the many blessings He has given me.</p>
