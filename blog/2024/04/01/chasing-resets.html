    <p>A true story.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right; padding: 20px"><tr><td><img src="/img/chasing-resets/cost-estimate.svg" width="240" /></td></tr></table>
<p>Some years ago, given a customer’s honest need and request, I proposed a
change to a client’s <a href="/blog/2021/03/06/asic-lsns.html">ASIC</a>
IP.  Specifically, I wanted to add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC
checking</a>,
based upon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
kept in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band">out-of-band memory
region</a>, to verify the ability
to properly read memory regions error free.  I said the change shouldn’t take
more than about two weeks, and I’d clean up some other problems I was aware of
in the mean time.  This change solved an urgent problem, so he agreed
to it.</p>

<p>By the time I was done, my 80 hr proposal had turned into 270+ hrs of work.</p>

<h2 id="build-it-well">Build it well</h2>

<p>I’d like to start my discussion of what went wrong with a list of good
practices to follow.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px;"><caption>Fig 1. Basic test bench components</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/chasing-resets/verilogtb.svg" width="320" /></td></tr></table>
<p>Just as a background, a general test bench follows the format shown in Fig. 1,
on the right.  The “test bench” itself is composed of a series of scripts.
These scripts then interact with a common test bench “library”, which then
makes requests of an AXI bus via a “bus functional model”.  This project
was designed to make minor changes to the device under test.</p>

<p>With that vocabulary under our belt, here are some of the good practices
I would expect to find in a well built design.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic numbers</a>.</p>

    <p>Yes, I harp on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic
numbers</a>
a lot.  There’s a reason for it.  While it wasn’t hard at all to make the
requested changes, I had to come back later and spend more than two weeks
chasing down
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic numbers</a>
buried in the test bench.</p>

    <p>Specifically, I wanted to add a hardware capability to calculate and store
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a> in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band">out
of band</a> area on a storage
device, and then to check those values again when reading the data back.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>s
can be calculated and checked
quickly and efficiently in hardware–especially if the data is already
moving.  Unfortunately, the test bench had hard coded locations where
everything was supposed to land in the hardware, and as a result all of
these locations needed updating in order to add room for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>.</p>

    <p>I spent quite a bit of time chasing down all of these
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic numbers</a>.</p>

    <p>This applies to register address names as well–but we’ll come back to
these in a moment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)">“Rule of three”: If you have to write the same thing three times,
refactor it</a>.</p>

    <p>If the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic
numbers</a>
were confined to one or two places, that would be
one thing.  Unfortunately, they were found throughout the test library
copied from place to place to place.  Every one of those copies then needed
personal attention to double check, in order to answer the question of
whether or not the “copied” number was truly a copied number that could
be modified or removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Name your register addresses.  It makes moving them easier.</p>

    <p>Or, in this case, four versions of this IP earlier someone had removed a
control register from the IP.  The address was then reallocated for another
purpose.  No one noticed the test scripts were still accessing the old
register until I came along and tried to assign names to all of the
registers within the IP.  I then asked, where is the XYZ register?  It’s
not at this address …</p>

    <p>I hate coming across situations like this.  “Fixing” such situations
always risks making a change (which needs to be made) that then might break
something else later.  (Yes, that happens too …)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s a benefit to naming even one bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic
numbers</a>.</p>

    <p>Not to get side tracked, but in another design there was a one-bit
number to indicate data direction.  Throughout the logic, you’d find
expressions like: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if (direction)</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if (!direction)</code>.  While you
might think this was okay, the designer wrote the design for the wrong
sense.</p>

    <p>I then came along and then wanted to “fix” things.</p>

    <p>Not knowing how deep the corruption lie, or whether or not I was getting
the direction mapping right in the first place, I changed all of these
expressions to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if (direction == DIR_SOURCE)</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if (direction == DIR_SINK)</code>.  This way, if necessary, I could come back
later and change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DIR_SOURCE</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DIR_SINK</code> at one location (okay, one per
file …) and then trust that everything would change consistently
throughout the design.</p>

    <p>I got things “mostly” right on my first pass.  The place where I struggled
was in the test bench, where things were named backwards.  Why?  Because if
the design was the <em>source</em>, the test bench needed to be the <em>sink</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That reset delay.</p>

    <p>This is really what I want to discuss today.  How long should a design be
held in reset before being released?</p>

    <p>My personal answer?  No longer than it needs to be.  Xilinx asks for a 16
clock period AXI reset.  Most designs don’t need this.  Indeed, most
digital designs can reset themselves in a single clock period, although some
require two.</p>

    <p>Some designs do very validly need a long reset.  I’ve come across this often
where an analog tracking circuit needs to start and lock before the digital
logic should start working with the results of that circuit.  This
make sense, I can understand it, and I’ve built this sort of thing before
when the hardware requires it.  SDRAMs often require long resets as well,
on the order of 200us.</p>

    <p>In the case of today’s example and lesson learned story, the test bench for
the digital portion of the design was using a 1,000 clock reset.  That is,
the test bench held the design in reset for 1,000 clock cycles.  Why?  That’s
a good question.  Nothing in the IP required such a long reset.  So, I
changed it to 3 cycles.  Three cycles was still overkill–one cycle
should’ve been sufficient, but simulation time can be expensive.  Why
waste simulation time if you don’t need to?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: right; padding: 20px"><tr><td><img src="/img/chasing-resets/initial-turn-in.svg" width="240" /></td></tr></table>

<p>After changing to a 3 cycle reset, the design worked fine and passed its
   test cases.  I turned my work in, and counted the project done.  All my
   work had been completed in (roughly) the 80 hours I had projected.
   Nice.</p>

<p>(Okay, my notes say my initial turn in took closer to 120hrs, but I’m going
   to tell the story and pretend my cost estimate was 80hrs.  I can eat a
   40hr overrun on an 80hr contract if I have to–especially if it’s an
   overrun in what I had proposed to do.)</p>

<ol start="6">
  <li>
    <p>Constants should be constant.  Parameters are there for that purpose.</p>

    <p>If a design has a startup constant, something it depends upon, then that
constant should be set on <em>startup</em>–before the first clock tick is
over, and not later.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: left"><tr><td><img src="/img/chasing-resets/parameters.svg" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Some engineers like to specify fixed design parameters via input ports
   rather than parameters.  While there are good reasons for doing
   this–especially in
   <a href="/blog/2021/03/06/asic-lsns.html">ASIC</a> designs,
   those fixed constants should be set before the first clock cycle.  If they
   are supposed to be equivalent to wires that are hardwired to either power
   or ground, then they should act like it.</p>

<p>Personally, I think this purpose is better served by parameters rather
   than hard wired constants, but I can understand a need to build an
   <a href="/blog/2021/03/06/asic-lsns.html">ASIC</a> that
   can then be reconfigured in the field via hard switches.  For example,
   consider how switches can be used to adjust the FPGA wires controlling the
   boot source.  In other words, there is a time for configuring a design via
   input wires.  Just … make those values constants from startup for
   simulation purposes.</p>

<ol start="7">
  <li>
    <p>Calculated values should be <em>calculated</em>, not set in fixed macros.</p>

    <p>This particular design depended upon a set of macros, and one test
configuration required one set of macros whereas another test configuration
might require another set of macros.</p>

    <p>These macros contained all kinds of computed constants.  For instance, if
the design had 512 byte ECC blocks, then the block boundaries were things
like bytes 0-511, 512-1023, 1024-1535, etc–all captured in macros used by
the test bench, and all dependent on the devices page size.  Further
constants captured things like where the ECC would be located in a page, or
how many ECC bytes were used for the given ECC size–which was also a macro.</p>

    <p>These constants got even worse when it came time to test the ECC.  In this
case, there were macros specifying where to place the errors.  So, for
example, the test bench for a 4bit ECC might generate one error in bytes
0-63, one in bytes 64-127, and macros existed defining these ranges all the
way up to the (macro-defined) size of the page which could be 2kB, 4kB, 8kB,
etc.</p>

    <p>Sadly, the test script would only run a set of 30 test cases for <em>one</em> set
of macros.  The design then needed to be reconfigured if you wanted to run
it with another set of macros.  Specifically, every time you needed to change
which ECC option you were testing, or which device model you wished to test
against, then you needed to switch macro sets.  In all, there were over 50
sets of macros, and each macro set contained between 40-150 macros the
design required in order to operate.  Worse, many of those macros were
externally calculated.  Running all tests required starting and restarting
the test driver, one macro set at a time.</p>

    <p>Here was the problem:  What happens when a macro set configures the IP
to run in one fashion, and you need to reconfigure your operations
mid-sim-runtime to another macro set?  More specifically, what happens when
you need to boot with one ECC option (defined as a macro), and then switch
to another?  In this case, the macro set determined how memory was laid
out, and the customer wanted to change the memory layout in the middle of
a test run.  (He then couldn’t figure out why this was a problem for us …)</p>

    <p>Lesson learned?  When some configuration points are dependent upon others,
use functions and calculate them within the IP.  That way, if you switch
things around later–or even at runtime, those test-library functions can
still capture all the necessary dependencies.</p>

    <p>Second lesson learned?  IP should be configured via <em>parameters</em>, not
macros, and those parameters should all be able to be scripted by the test
driver.  Perhaps you may recall how I discussed handling this in an article
discussing an upgrade to the <a href="/zipcpu/2022/07/04/zipsim.html">ZipCPU’s test
infrastructure</a> some time
back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If requirements are in flux, the IP can’t be delivered.</p>

    <p>This should be a simple given, a basic no-brainer–it’s really basic
engineering 101.  If you don’t know what you want built, you shouldn’t
hire someone to build it until you have solid requirements.  If you want
to change things mid-task, any rework that will be required is going to be
charged against your bottom line.</p>

    <p>In this case, the end customer of this IP discovered how I was intending
to meet their requirement by adding a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>.
They then wanted things done
in a different manner.  Specifically, they wanted the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>s
stored somewhere else.  Of course, this didn’t take place until after I’d
already proposed a fixed price contract based upon 80 hours of work, and
accomplished most
of that work.  Sure, I can support some changes–if the changes are minor.
For example, I initially built a 32b
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
capability and they then wanted a 16b
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
capability.  I figured that’d be a cheap change–since the design was (now)
well parameterized, only two parameters needed to change to adjust.
In this case, however, their simple desire to switch
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
sizes from 32b to 16b now doubled the time spent in verification–since we
now needed to run the verification test suite twice–once for a 32b
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a> and once again
for the 16b <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a> they
wanted.  Their other change request, moving the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
storage elsewhere, was major enough that it couldn’t be done without
starting the entire update over from scratch.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: right; padding: 20px"><tr><td><img src="/img/chasing-resets/crcsz.svg" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Change is normal.  Customers don’t always know what they want.  I get that.
   The problem here was that as long as requirements were in flux I wasn’t
   going to deliver any capability.  Let’s agree on what we’re going to deliver
   first, then I’ll deliver that.</p>

<p>Then the customer started asking why it was taking so long to deliver the
   promised changes, when could we deliver the IP, and they had a hard RTL
   freeze deadline, and …  Yes, this became quite contradictory: 1) They
   wanted me to make a change that would force me to start my work all over
   from scratch, but at the same time 2) wanted all of my changes delivered
   immediately to meet their hard deadline.</p>

<p>You can’t make this stuff up.</p>

<ol start="9">
  <li>
    <p>If a design can fail, then a simulation test case should exist that can
trigger that failure.</p>

    <p>This is especially true of <a href="/blog/2021/03/06/asic-lsns.html">ASIC</a> designs, and a lesson I’m needing to learn
in a hard way.  In my case, I knew that I could properly calculate and
detect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
errors.  I had formally proven that.</p>

    <p>However, because I didn’t (initially) generate a simulation test to verify
what would happen on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
failure, no one noticed how complicated the register handling for these
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
failures had become.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test bench drivers should mirror software</p>

    <p>At some point in time, someone’s going to need to build control software.
They’ll start with the test bench driver.  The closer that test bench
driver looks to real software, the easier their task will be.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>

<p>Okay, ready for the story?</p>

<p>Here’s what happened: I made my changes inside my promised two weeks.  I
merged and delivered the changes the customer had requested.  Everything worked.</p>

<p>Life was good.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 2. Everything fell apart when merging</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/chasing-resets/merge-failures.svg" width="320" /></td></tr></table>
<p>Then my client then said, oops, we’re sorry, you made the changes to the wrong
version of the IP.  The end customer had asked us to make a simple change to
allow the software to read a sector from non-volatile memory to boot from on
startup.  Here’s the correct version to change.</p>

<p>The changes appeared minor, so I merged my changes and re-submitted.  This
time, many of the tests now failed.</p>

<p>What went wrong?</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 25px"><caption>Fig 3. I now use watchdog timers in my test benches</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/chasing-resets/watchdogs.svg" width="320" /></td></tr></table>
<p>The first problem was the reset.  Remember how I removed that 1,000 clock reset,
because it wasn’t needed?  One of the test cases was waiting 100 clock cycles,
and then calling a startup task which would then set the “constant” input values
that were only sampled during reset.  This value would determine whether
the new bootloader capability would be run on startup or not.  The test bench
would then wait on the signal that the bootloader had completed its task.
However, with a 3 cycle reset, the boot on startup constant was never set
before the end of the reset period, so the bootloader never started and the
test bench then hung waiting for the bootloader to complete.  (Waiting on a
non-existent boot loader wasn’t a part of the design I started with.)</p>

<p>It didn’t help that the test script (in file #1) called a task (in file #2),
that set a value (in file #3), that was checked elsewhere (in file #4), that
was … In other words, there was so much indirection on this reset between
where it was set and its ultimate consequence that it took quite a bit of time
to sort through.  No, it didn’t help that I hadn’t written this IP, nor its
test bench, nor its test scripts, nor its test libraries in the first place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that was only the first problem.</p>

<p>The second problem was due to an implied requirement that, if your test bench
reads from memory on bootup, there must be an initial set of valid data in
memory for it to boot from–especially if you are checking for valid
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>s and failing a
test if any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a> failed.
This requirement didn’t exist in either branch, but became an implied
requirement once the boot up and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
branches were merged together.  We hadn’t forseen that one coming either.</p>

<p>A third problem came from how fault detection was handled.  In the case of
a fault, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a>
 would be generated.  The test bench would wait for that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a>, read the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> register from the IP, and
then handle each active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a>
as appropriate.</p>

<p>In order to properly handle a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
failure, I needed to adjust how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a>s were handled in the test
library.  That’s fair.  Let’s look at that logic for a moment.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">Interrupt</a>s were handled in the test
library within a Verilog task.  The relevant portion of this task read
something like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">do</span> <span class="k">begin</span>

<p>This was a hidden violation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)">rule of
three</a>,
since you’d find the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a>
handler for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> #1 following
a check for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> register
equalling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8'h01</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8'h03</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8'h05</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8'h07</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Worse, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> handlers didn’t
just handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a>s.  They would
also issue commands, reset the interrupt register, use delays, etc., so that
handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> #1 wasn’t the
same between a reading of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8'h01</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8'h05</code>.</p>

<p>My solution was to spend about two days refactoring this, so that every
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> would be given its own
independent handler properly.  The result looked something like the logic below.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">do</span> <span class="k">begin</span>
		<span class="k">wait</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">interrupt</span><span class="p">);</span>
		<span class="n">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">interrupt_register</span><span class="p">);</span>

		<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">interrupt_register</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="k">begin</span>
			<span class="c1">// Handle interrupt #1</span>
		<span class="k">end</span>

		<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">interrupt_register</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="k">begin</span>
			<span class="c1">// Handle interrupt #2</span>
		<span class="k">end</span>

		<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">interrupt_register</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="k">begin</span>
			<span class="c1">// Handle interrupt #3</span>
		<span class="k">end</span> <span class="c1">// ...</span>

		<span class="n">clear_interrupts</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// and adjust the mask if necessary</span>
	<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">while</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">task_not_done</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Among other things, I removed all of the register accesses from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> “handling” routines,
capturing their needs instead in some registers so the accesses could all
happen at the end.  As a result, <em>nothing</em> took simulation time during these
handlers and things truly could be merged properly.</p>

<p>I was proud of this update.  The portion of the test library handling
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a>s now “made sense”.</p>

<p>So, I sent the design off to the test team again only to have it come back to
me again a couple days later.  It had failed another test case.  Where?  In a
second <em>copy</em> of the same broken
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> handler that I had just
refactored.</p>

<p>While I might argue that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)">rule of
three</a>
should’ve applied to this second copy, you could also argue that it didn’t
simply because it was a <em>second</em> copy of the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> handler and not
a <em>third</em>.</p>

<p>I could go on.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the beginning, a basic 80 hour task became a 270+ hour task.
Further, the task went from being <em>on time</em> to late very suddenly.  Yes,
this was how I spent my Thanksgiving weekend that year.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>A good design plus test bench <em>should</em> be easy to adjust and modify.</p>

<p>Building a poor design, a poor test bench, or (worse) both constitutes taking
out a loan from your future self.  This is often called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical
debt</a>.”
If this is a prototype you are willing to throw away later, then perhaps this
is okay.  If not, then you will end up paying that loan back later, with
interest, at a time you are not expecting to pay it.  It will cost you more
than you want to pay, at a time when you aren’t expecting a delay.</p>

<p>What about formal methods?  Certainly formal methods might have helped, no?</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 25px"><tr><td><img src="/img/vlog-wait/rule-of-gold.svg" width="320" /></td></tr></table>
<p>I suppose so.  Indeed, all of my updates were formally verified.  Better yet,
everything that was formally verified worked right the first time.  What about
the stuff that failed?  None of it had ever seen a formal tool.  Test bench
scripts, libraries, and device models, for example, tend not to be formally
verified.  Further, why would you formally verify a “working” design that you
were handed?  Unless, of course, it was never truly “working” in the first
place.</p>

<p>Remember, well verified, well tested RTL designs are gold in this business.
Build them well, and you can sell or re-use them for years to come.</p>
