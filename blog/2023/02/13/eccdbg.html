    <p>There are a couple of really hard problems in digital design.  These include
debugging <a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>s,
cryptographic algorithms, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">Error Correction Coding
(ECC)</a>.
Debugging a good compression algorithm is also a solid runner up, but it’s
not quite as difficult as the others.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><tr><td><img src="/img/eccdbg/dbgchallenge.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>What makes these problems hard is the debugging challenge: put simply,
given a failing design, pinpoint the line (or lines) of failing logic.
This debugging challenge is hard because these particular problems don’t
break down easily into visually reducible sub-problems.  That is, it can
be a real challenge when working with problems like these is to first
identify the problem in the trace, and then to be able to walk backwards
from there to the bug.</p>

<p>Take, for example, an <a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>.
Some time ago, a user came to me telling me my
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>
was broken.  Nonsense I said, it works fine for me.  So he sent me a <a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">VCD
trace</a>, and sure enough, the
I<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a> of an
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a> wasn’t producing the
input again.
It wasn’t even close.  The challenge here was that this user had introduced
random data into the system.  Because it was <em>random</em>, it was hard to tell at
every stage what the <em>right</em> answer should’ve been and therefore where in
the algorithm did the design break.</p>

<p>How then do you debug these complex algorithms?</p>

<h2 id="to-debug-build-new-tools-when-necessary">To debug: Build new tools when necessary</h2>

<p>Remember, the goal is to find the one (or more) lines of HDL that are broken.</p>

<p>Recently, I was asked to do some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
work.  It started out simple: here’s a working
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
design, now generate a piece of software that will replicate it.
Okay, there’s more to the backstory.  The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
was part of a non-volatile memory controller, and the customer wanted to
pre-load the device at the factory with data and valid
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
parity bits.  Not a problem, right?  Most, but not all,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
is just straight linear algebra over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GF%282%29">Galois Field 2
(GF2)</a>, so this should be basic, no?</p>

<table align="center" style="padding: 25px; float: left"><caption>Fig 1. ECC wraps the CRC, which then wraps the user data</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/eccdbg/eccpkt.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The problems got worse from there.  Gee, Dr. Dan, since you’re an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a> expert (Wait, what?
I am?), why not maintain some logic for me?  Here’s your first task: a
customer wants 32-bit error correction.  Our standard 16-bit error correction
isn’t good enough for this customer.  Then, once that task was done, the next
task was for a customer who wanted even more error correction than just
32-bits per packet.  Then there was the customer who wanted not just
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>, but an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a> protected
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
so that he could tell if the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a> ever failed.</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but how do you debug this stuff?  Remember, the
debugging challenge is to find the line (or lines) of HDL (VHDL or Verilog)
containing the bug.  Also remember, I didn’t write the original logic–I’m
just the one getting paid to maintain it.</p>

<p>Here’s the method I came up with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Start with a golden reference.</p>

    <p>This may seem like the hardest part at first.  I mean, if you are building
an algorithm for the first time, how will you know that your golden
reference works properly in the first place?</p>

    <p>It helps to start with the references from others.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Recipes-Scientific-Computing-Second/dp/0521431085/">Numerical Recipes in
C </a>
publishes the C source of an
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a> algorithm that I’ve since
used often.  There’s even a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Recipes-Art-Scientific-Computing/dp/8175960965">Numerical Recipes in
C++</a>,
which I would expect is the same recipes but with an updated coding
standard.  Then there’s the “Advanced Encryption Standard” (AES), which
includes an appendix showing what the outputs should look like at each
stage of the encryption standard given a known key and a known input.
There’s also at least one <a href="https://opencores.org/projects/tiny_aes">AES algorithm on
OpenCores</a> that you might use.
In general, references are available for your work with digital design,
you might just need to spend some time looking for them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add debug <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$display</code> statements to the design, and make them both human
readable and computer friendly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use those debug statements to feed the golden reference.</p>

    <p>This is the key feature I’ll be discussing in a moment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now look for the first difference between the reference and any broken 
trace.</p>

    <p>Remember, the golden reference <em>works</em>.  Therefore, any discrepancy or
other difference between the golden reference and your design will be
something you want to dig into.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s walk through how this works, by discussing the last
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
problem I worked on: adding a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
to a memory controller, prior to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
parity generator and then checking it at the back end.</p>

<p>What made this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
task challenging was that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
parity bits were packed together–even across byte boundaries.  The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a> bits, therefore,
needed to be packed together with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
parity bits.  Not only that, both needed to be gathered together and assembled
separate from the data itself.  Together, this created data blocks looking
somewhat like Fig. 2 below when transmitted.  (Note that the Fig 2. is not
drawn to scale by any means.)</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2. Data backs consisted of data blocks, followed by CRC then parity</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/eccdbg/packet.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The original algorithm I was given handled this via a combined shift
register and memory implementation that had grown to over 2k lines
of Verilog.  It read like a series of cascaded case statements: if this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
option, this data block size, the data block number, then adjust these bits,
etc.)  Indeed, by the time I started working with this logic, it had
gotten so repetitive that I was using a C++ program to write and update these
thousands of lines of Verilog for me.  Now, this may have been fine originally,
for the simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
codes this controller was originally built to handle, but the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
bit-vector had now grown to over 7k bits, each individually accessed, and none
able to be optimized into memory properly.  It got so bad that this part of
the algorithm was starting to dominate the total area cost–and I was going to
add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>s
to this mess?  No, that wasn’t going to happen–not without a rewrite.</p>

<p>So, I rewrote the algorithm with a proper gearbox coupled with a proper FIFO.
Moreover, in the hopes that I might be able to reuse the implementation, I
built the gearboxes using standard interfaces: AXI stream, VALID, READY, LAST,
etc, and I even parameterized the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
size so the customer could change it at a later time if they wished to.  All
told, the new implementation took just over 1k Verilog lines of code, and at
least half of that was either comments or formal properties.  That meant
there was a rough 4x reduction in the number of lines of code.  Does this
mean the design is simpler?  In this case, definitely!  It was both simpler
to understand, easier to see what was going on within it, and therefore
simpler to maintain.  The giant tables had been replaced.  The new design
also used less area, so we’re good all around.</p>

<p>But, how to debug this?</p>

<p>To give you an idea, then general test setup I was given looked something like
Fig. 3 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3. Test bench setup</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/eccdbg/dbgpath.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>A test bench script would drive the entire test.  This script would generate
commands to write pseudorandom data to the memory device.  Then, once all the
data had been written, the script would command an error generator to
insert errors into the read path, and then generate commands to read from
the memory device.  The results would be compared against the data written to
the device.  If (and <em>only</em> if) the number of errors inserted was beyond the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>’s
correction ability, then the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
failure flag was to be set.  In all other cases, the data returned from the
device was required to match the data sent to it.</p>

<p>Now consider all the steps involved in this process, and ask yourself where
and how would you debug all of this?</p>

<p>The (obvious) answer should be: starting with unit tests.  Each individual
unit should be tested and verified separately, and known to work before
being integrated into the larger whole.  For unit tests, I turn to formal
methods.  One of the things I like about formal methods is that, any time you
get a property (i.e. an assertion) failure, that failure will lead you directly
to the failed assertion, which is usually nearby the logic it defends, and so
formal methods will typically find bugs in about 5-10 steps.  In my case here,
the gearboxes required 40 steps.  Why so many?  Because of a technical problem.
Formal methods don’t handle division very well, and a full induction description
would require that the formal methods implement a divide.  As a result, I
didn’t get induction working.  Still, 40 time steps was enough to give me
strong confidence the gearboxes worked.</p>

<p>My next step was to use a bench test with
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>.
You can see this basic setup in Fig. 4 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4. Verilog unit testing</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/eccdbg/vgolden.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In this case, the <em>unit</em> under test was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
block separated from the
rest of the design.  In particular, this unit testing approach allowed me
to separate my test from the AXI bus interface, the device interface, and the
device model.  Data came into the test design via the AXI stream protocol,
and then the same protocol was used to take data back out once encoded or
decoded.  Still, as you can see from the figure, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
block under test wasn’t quite the <em>working</em> design given to me, but
rather my modified version of it, now containing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>
generation and checking.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 5. Test vector choice</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/eccdbg/tbdesign.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>One key to this type of testing was the test vectors chosen.  For example,
when building an <a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>,
you’ll want to use both impulses and sine waves.  Since this is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>, i.e. linear math
over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GF%282%29">GF2</a>, I started with vectors of
all zeros, and then vectors with a single bit set, and only then a small number
of countable bits set.  From there I moved on to all bits set and then random
settings.</p>

<p>What if the design fails with random data?  In that case, you just reduce the
random data vector back to the relevant basis vectors, and try again.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it wasn’t too difficult to get this
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
based test bench working.
In general, the trace led me straight to any bugs–well, that and the fact that
I knew that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
algorithm worked initially, so the only thing that could’ve
broken would be associated with one of my changes.  That meant that this
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
test bench could then become my “golden reference” model.</p>

<p>Once things worked in this “golden” model, I could then integrate this updated
design back into the memory controller it was originally a part of. 
Not only that, but remember this was a maintenance task.  In other words,
I needed to modify logic someone else had written years ago, logic that
I wasn’t familiar with–a recipe for problems, no?</p>

<p>This brings us back to the integrated test bench design shown in Fig. 3.
The good news is that we come into this integrated test design with something
known to work.</p>

<p>Now, let me point out a problem with the type of integrated testing shown in
Fig. 3: the test bench script won’t notice any data failures until late in
the process.  This is just the nature of the perspective of a black box.
Data will first need to be written to a staging area, then pushed through
the device path, transferred to the external memory device model, then
transferred back, then copied out of the controller–and only then would any
errors be noted and flagged–all in good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing">black box testing
fashion</a>.</p>

<p>This wonderful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing">black box
testing</a>
fashion might be great for proving that a
design does what it is supposed to, but it is horrible for telling you what
fails when it fails.  Why?  Because the failure isn’t noticed until microseconds
of simulation time later, and only after thousands of data transfers.  That’s
a lot of trace you have to back through manually to find any bugs.  There’s
another word for that: pain.</p>

<p>This is where the debugging statements came into the design.  To show you what
I mean, the following lines have been clipped from the design.  First,
as every word went into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>, and now the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a>+<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
algorithm, I dumped it to the simulation log.</p>

<p>We can call this test point #1.</p>

<p>Once an entire block of data had gone through the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
encoder, it would then generate parity bits.  I dumped these to the same
log as well.</p>

<p>(This test point doesn’t get a number, because my diagram in Fig. 3

<p>I repeated the same process on receive.  As data came into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a> decoder,
it was also dumped to the log.</p>

<p>We can call this test point #2.</p>

<p>Before moving on, I should point out a key feature of this test point that
I don’t want to pass up, and that is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$time</code>.  One of the challenges of
working with both simulation logs and trace files together is synchronizing the
two.  That’s where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$time</code> comes in handy, and I’ve gotten to using it in
this manner often.  Because this test point outputs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$time</code>, I can now use
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$time</code> in this log to find the associated step in the trace and to
then see the context associated with this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$display()</code> function call.</p>

<p>Finally, when the decoder made it’s error correction decisions, those were
also dumped to the log.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We can call this test point #3.</p>

<p>For reference, you can see all of these test points in Fig. 6 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 6. Test points</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/eccdbg/testpoints.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The first step to analyzing this log file was to search for all lines
starting with “ECC-“.  In the future, if I do this again, I’ll probably write
to a specific
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
log file, but for now these messages were dumped together
with the rest of the simulation log.  The good news is that the rest of the
simulation log provides the context for what’s going on.  The bad news is that
dumping 16kB of data for an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
engine doesn’t make a pseudo human-readable log any more legible.  Because
of the mess this makes of the simulation log, I’ve gated all of this logic
with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OPT_ECC_DEBUG</code> parameter and only turn the parameter on when I
need to.</p>

<p>Even before building any better capabilities, this helped: it allowed me to
see the data going into the gearboxes, and then coming out again.  I could
then make sure that things were lined up properly.</p>

<p>It wasn’t enough.</p>

<p>One particular problem was that the TX and RX data were so far separated in
time.  That made it difficult to tell whether any problem lied between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a> components, such
as in the transmitter to the device, the memory model, the test-bench error
generator, or the receive logic on the other end.  However, it wasn’t all
that hard to generate a simple C++ program to process this pseudo human-readable
data, to place the TX data next to the RX data and then notice if anything had
changed.  This one piece of software alone helped me catch nearly all of my
bugs.  (Remember, I started with a <em>working</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
design–that means most bugs should be confined to my changes alone.
Unfortunately, I changed a lot of stuff.)</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 7. Feeding the golden reference model</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/eccdbg/binfile.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>That software alone, however, wasn’t sufficient.  It was close, but not quite
there, and this is where today’s particular problem comes into play: because
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
is a challenge to debug, I needed to know more of what was going on <em>inside</em>
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">ECC</a>
algorithm.  This is where the third debugging step comes
into play: feeding the golden reference model.  That is, I adjusted my
log reading program so that it could generate a binary file that could then
be ingested into my golden reference model, as shown in Fig. 7 above.</p>

<table align="center" style="padding: 25px; float: left"><tr><td><img src="/img/eccdbg/feedref.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>At one point, it was only by comparing the trace coming out of the golden
reference model with the one from my larger integrated test environment that
I found the bug.  One of the bugs I found was even in
the <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
translation of my Verilog, and so I thank the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
team, and in this case Mr. Snyder in particular, for fixing it quickly.</p>

<h2 id="customers">Customers</h2>

<p>I wish I could say this was the end of the story: the design worked, and should
now be shipped.  Sadly, it wasn’t.  Three further problems then turned the
simple update listed above into a nightmare for both my team and our customer.</p>

<p>First, as a simple background, let me set the stage: I offered to make this
maintenance upgrade for a simple two weeks of work.  The updates were simple
enough, they should’ve only taken two weeks.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><tr><td><img src="/img/eccdbg/requirements.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>It was only once those two weeks were over that the challenges began.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Once I was ready to turn in the work, the customer started demanding
other changes.  (Changes that they had no intention of paying for …)
Worse, they were asking for fundamental changes which would force me
back to the drawing board for this design.</p>

    <p>The laughable part of these demands?  In the same breath they asked for
a fundamental redesign, they also asked for the current design to be
shipped in order to support their RTL freeze date in less than two more
weeks.  Then they were upset when we didn’t deliver according to their
schedule, when they were the ones who changed the requirements mid-task.
Seriously.  You just can’t make this stuff up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One problem I wasn’t expecting was that the memory device model implemented
address regions not present in the actual memory device.  Adding a four byte
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">CRC</a> required all
of the addresses within to be updated to make room for these extra four
bytes.  How many places did these addresses need to be updated in?  Let’s
just say that I really dislike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic
numbers</a>, since
their usage in this project by the prior developer made this part of the
update all the more painful.</p>

    <p>You can read some more of <a href="/blog/2022/09/21/vlog-wait.html">my thoughts on test bench design
here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last problem was a repository merge nightmare.  Sadly, I had made my
changes to a design that wasn’t the “latest” design–the customer had
submitted changes to the design that I was unaware of.  I didn’t discover
this until after I had turned my changes in.  Then I discovered I was
about two versions behind the official latest version.  Bugs discovered
here were …  anything but what I was expecting.</p>

    <p>For example, one of the test scripts depended upon a 1000 clock cycle
reset.  This script would wait 100 cycles, then set a “fixed” value that
needed to be referenced when the design came out of reset.  The test bench
script then then waited for the signal that this (optional) startup process
had taken place.  Not knowing this, I had come along and tried to speed
up the simulation by switching to a 3-cycle reset and … all kinds of
regression hell broke lose when the two “working” designs needed to be
merged.  Was there any documentation discussing why a 1000 clock cycle
reset was necessary, or why a key reset input wouldn’t get set until 100
clock cycles into the simulation?  Well, one might hope.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The end result was that I spent another 2-3 months, beyond the 2-week update
task, working on the test bench, rebuilding the model, fixing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic
numbers</a>,
fixing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)">the many places the same task was
accomplished</a> in error, and more.</p>

<p>My simple two week task?  Sure, it took two weeks to do.  It then took another
two months arguing with the customer over what the requirements needed to be.
Another month was then spent chasing down bugs associated with merging
the repository, and then another two were spent dealing with further
consequences of the original merge as they continued to ripple through the
<a href="/blog/2022/09/21/vlog-wait.html">test model and test script
library</a>.</p>

<p>And the customer?  The customer wanted to know why the design couldn’t be
delivered the same afternoon that I submitted my changes to the official
repository.  Worse, they are now convinced that the problems associated with
these updates are due to the unreliability of the IP they purchased, rather
than rippling consequences of the changes they made working their way
through the design.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>When faced with a really <em>hard</em> HDL problem, consider using a golden
reference model and comparing your design against that reference.  Any
differences between the two should lead you directly to any bugs.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><tr><td><img src="/img/tweets/bible/diligence.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>As for difficult customers?  Be honest.  Smile, and do your best.  There will
be other customers.</p>

<p>Oh, and the end of this tale?  I’m now working to port those same changes to
another controller, which means I get to reuse both my golden reference model,
as well as the software I used to reformat the data into something that could
be ingested into it.  Once I post this article, I’ll go back to looking for
the differences between the two.  The good Lord only knows what I’ll find
at this point.</p>
