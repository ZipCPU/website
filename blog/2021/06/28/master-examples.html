  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A <a href="https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Processor-System-Design-and-AXI/AXI-master-write-to-BRAM/td-p/1257966">Xilinx forum poster recently asked for some example designs they might
use when designing and creating an AXI
master</a>.  Since Xilinx has asked me not to post too many
links in any forum response, I thought I might post some AXI master examples
here that others might find valuable.</p>

<p>Here are some examples I have that you might find useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="/blog/2020/03/23/wbm2axisp.html">Building a basic AXI master</a>”
discusses how to build an AXI-lite master.  The article also presents some
decent performance metrics regarding Xilinx’s block RAM controller,
explaining why it’s faster to use AXI bursts with this controller than the
single-beat transactions used by AXI-lite.  You might find those comparisons
valuable.  Xilinx’s MIG design, however, isn’t so crippled–it’ll handle AXI
bursts as well as AXI (and lite) singletons without the throughput
performance loss of the block RAM controller, but … with a tremendous lag.
If you are looking for the design itself, you can find that
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/wbm2axisp">here</a>.
You can also find it in use within many of my designs, since I commonly
bridge from Wishbone to AXI in order to access any DDR3 SDRAM via Xilinx’s
MIG controller.  (Going from Wishbone to the MIG’s native interface would
be better, but I haven’t tried that yet.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilite2axi.v">AXI-lite is really easy to convert to AXI
full</a>.  So,
one might argue that an AXI-lite master <em>is</em> an AXI-full master.  I’ve had
to adjust my terms for precision, and so I often use the term “bursting AXI
master” to separate the difference that actually impacts things.  I’ll let
you decide whether the “bursting AXI master” term is a better or worse term
for this purpose–although I’m not really sure I have a better one beyond
that one to offer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you need to test an AXI master, then you might want a slave to test it
against.  The article, “<a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">Building the perfect AXI4
slave</a>”, discusses how a
slave can be built that can achieve 100% throughput in either AXI4(full) or
AXI4-lite.  Practically, however, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/demofull.v">the
design</a> suffers
from one clock cycle lost per burst since it insists that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AW*</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W*</code>
channels are offset by a beat, but otherwise it would’ve had 100% throughput.
Further, since writing the article, I’ve adjusted the design so that  1) the
outputs–the inputs to the externally attached RAM–are registered, and
2) it support AXI exclusive access.  Registering the outputs introduces a
cycle of delay, but it doesn’t impact the design’s throughput.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<a href="/blog/2020/06/16/axiaddr-limits.html">The hard part of building a bursting AXI
master</a>” discusses
the designs of several bursting AXI masters, and why they can be difficult
to build.  These include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Open source AXI DMA’s: <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">Memory to memory</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axis2mm.v">Stream to memory</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/aximm2s.v">Memory to stream</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Video DMAs: <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axivdisplay.v">Memory to video, as a framebuffer might use</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axivcamera.v">Video to memory, such as a video
recorder</a>
might require.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axivfifo.v">A “virtual” FIFO, which uses a RAM backing with an AXI4 interface</a>.
This can be useful when you need a <em>REALLY LARGE</em> FIFO, but not necessarily
a large throughput.  Sure, the design can theoretically achieve 100%
throughput, but I doubt any slave-interconnect-RAM combination would be
able to match it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I’ve also got an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/memscope.v">AXI backed “scope”</a>.
This follows <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">my basic Wishbone scope implementation</a>,
only it uses an AXI-lite register for read access and an AXI4 back end to
record any data written to it at high speeds.  (i.e. DMA speeds.)  This
would be great for digital signal processing work, for whenever I need to
record something at high speed and then break or stop when your run into
 some feature of interest that you want to go back to and inspect.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More recently, I’ve been building AXI master implementations of the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s memory controllers.  (You’ll
currently need to find these in a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/tree/zipcore">special branch of the ZipCPU’s
repository</a>,
as they represent a major upgrade in many ways.)  These AXI memory
controllers are often paired with an AXI-lite master equivalents.  For
example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>There’s a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axiops.v">basic AXI data controller</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilops.v">it’s AXI-lite equivalent</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axiops.v">AXI version is unique</a>
in that it’s my first foray into supporting exclusive access operations
from an AXI master standpoint–something AXI-lite doesn’t support.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There’s also a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axipipe.v">basic pipelined AXI data controller</a>
and it’s <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilpipe.v">AXI-lite equivalent</a>.
Again, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axipipe.v">this AXI master supports exclusive access</a>–something not supported by its
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilpipe.v">AXI-lite equivalent</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilfetch.v">basic instruction fetch</a>
(i.e. w/o cache) doesn’t benefit from AXI full, so the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilfetch.v">AXI-lite
version</a>
is all I have for it.  Still, it has support for an arbitrary number of
outstanding requests, which can be tuned at design integration time to
match the expected latency within your system.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> now also features two
AXI cache examples: A
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axidcache.v">data cache</a>
and an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axiicache.v">instruction cache</a>.
Both are single-way, and the data cache is a write-through cache design.
Both support AXI4 burst transactions.  Unlike my other AXI data interfaces,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axidcache.v">data cache</a>
can’t handle unaligned accesses, nor can it handle exclusive access (yet).
<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15">If the Lord wills</a>,
these may be features to be added later–although I’m more likely to add
uncached-pipeline reads before any other features.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not all masters are information sources.  Often a bridge makes a good example
design.  For example, my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axi2axilite.v">AXI-full to AXI-lite
bridge</a> can
achieve 100% throughput at the cost of two additional cycles of latency.  I
also (now) have a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axi2axilsub.v">similar bridge that can bridge to a smaller AXI(lite)
interface</a>,
although this second bridge has yet to be formally verified.  True, these
are only <em>AXI-lite</em> masters, and not really <em>AXI-full</em> masters.  I have
started building an AXI4 full data upsizer, but that design remains confused
enough that it won’t get past a couple cycles of formal verification.
(When I couldn’t wait any longer, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilupsz.v">I built an AXI-lite data
upsizer</a>–which
is functionally equivalent, but won’t preserve the burst capability of AXI4.
The original, still in progress AXI4 upsizer, would’ve preserved the burst
capability.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d like example designs that use these controllers, then feel free to
consider either my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/tree/dev">VGASIM</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/axidmacheck/tree/zipcpu">AXI
DMA check</a> repositories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/tree/dev">VGASIM</a>  includes demonstrations
of the video DMA’s either<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/dev/bench/rtl/axidemo.v">generating video either from a static
framebuffer</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/dev/bench/rtl/axirepeater.v">after first writing a section of the screen to a framebuffer
(continuously) and then reading that back to the
screen</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/axidmacheck/tree/zipcpu">AXI DMA check</a>
repository also includes a test bed for the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s AXI interfaces–something
I’ve been experimenting with recently.  (My goal has been to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilperf.v">measure AXI
performance</a>,
but I have yet to be pleased with the ability of my chosen measurements to
capture what’s actually going on so far.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Beware, both of these repositories are simulation only designs.  (In the Air
Force, we might call them “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hangar_queen">hangar
queens</a>”.)  They won’t
necessarily pass timing or resource requirements to fit on any practical
FPGA chip, but they are sufficient to verify that the core components within
them work as designed.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1. AXI is not a simple protocol</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/tweets/axi-not-simple.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Finally, let me warn anyone attempting to build their own AXI master: <em>AXI4
can be hard to get right</em>.  I’m not sure I can emphasize that enough.  While
many of these designs have <a href="/formal/2020/06/12/four-keys.html">“just worked” the first time
out</a> (after being
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verified</a>, of
course!) – I can’t say the same for the designs of others.  Worse, one AXI
bug can easily bring the whole system down while offering you no insight into
where the bug took place.  If that weren’t bad enough, <a href="/blog/2021/03/20/xilinx-forums.html">I’m tracking many bugs
that have lived in the Xilinx repositories for years that just don’t get
triggered</a>.  They
weren’t triggered by simulation, they weren’t triggered during sign off, but
can often be triggered by some inconsequential change in the design elsewhere
that then leads you looking in all the wrong places for the bug.  Hence, when
and if they do get triggered they often don’t lead to bug reports–since it
can be hard to pinpoint the fault at that late stage in the game.  I’ll also
point out that it’s not just Xilinx–even ASIC designs struggle with getting
their AXI interfaces right.  Indeed, <a href="/blog/2020/06/16/axiaddr-limits.html">getting the AXI master right can truly be
a challenge</a>.
Simulation is a good start, but nothing beats a good formal verification check.</p>

<p>Still, perhaps one or more of these designs will help you get up and running
with your own design needs.</p>
