    <p>I wanted to share a quick design idea.  I think it’s an awesome <em>idea</em>, but
the frank reality at this point is that it is only an <em>idea</em>.  I haven’t
finished the implementation of it.  Or, rather, I have most of the
implementation complete, it takes less than 400 6–LUTs, and I haven’t yet
verified it.  Yes, verification is where the majority of the work will
lie–as always in this business.</p>

<p>Still, the idea I’m about to share is fundamental enough it’s worth sharing.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-telemetry">The Problem: Telemetry</h2>

<p>Here’s the basic problem: a client wants a small remote sensor.  This sensor
will be placed in a hostile environment (under water, on a rocket, in space,
wherever), where it will be impossible to electronically inspect or examine
it.  Because the environment this sensor will be in is so hostile to
electronics, it’s important to monitor the health, welfare, and status of
the sensor as a whole from a remote location.</p>

<p>This means that the sensor needs to report back to the surface not only the
sensor measurements themselves, but also other things such as: temperature
(is the sensor overheating?), voltage (is it using too much power?), and
other things such as air pressure or humidity.  For example, if water ever got
into the sensor chamber, there may be a bare minimum of time to save the
sensor before it is catastrophically destroyed.</p>

<p>You know, just the realities of life.</p>

<p>All of these “extra” measurements then need to be grouped together into a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a> stream, and forwarded
from the remote sensor to an operator somewhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">Wikipedia defines telemetry</a> (today)
as: “the in situ collection of measurements or other data at remote points and
their automatic transmission to receiving equipment (telecommunication) for
monitoring.”</p>

<p>This is a good definition for us, since this is exactly what needs to be
accomplished: multiple sensors need to be read, their readings time stamped,
and then returned via a data link.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1. An I2C Sensor bus requires only two wires</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate-i2c/i2cbus.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>For simple design reasons, it helps to share as many wires as possible between
various sensors, and this has lead the hardware team to connect multiple
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a> sensors across a single pair of
wires common to all the sensors as well as the FPGA–which will be acting as
the master and gathering the sensor data and reporting it.</p>

<p>So how shall such a system be implemented?</p>

<h2 id="design-requirements">Design Requirements</h2>

<p>Today, therefore, we’re discussing how to implement a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a>
system composed of measurements from a set of diverse
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
sensors all on the same bus.</p>

<p>Here’s the first reality hit, though: every sensor is different.  Some sensors
have single byte addresses, some two byte addresses, and some don’t support
addresses at all.  This means that every sensor needs its own startup script
and its own configuration.</p>

<p>Once configured, however, every sensor then needs to be polled at regular
intervals, and not all sensors need to be polled at the same interval.  In
order to meet the real time requirements of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a>
system, every frame collection must start at a specific time, and then complete
by a final time.  During this time, sensor measurements will be read and
reported.  This measure and report process will proceed ad infinitum.</p>

<p>The final output reporting will be done via a network data packet, where the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a>
data will be spread across every sensor data packet using only four
bytes per packet.  (Remember, the purpose of this system is <em>data</em> collection,
not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a>
collection.  The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a>
needs to remain a small and minor portion of this system.)</p>

<h2 id="design-choices">Design Choices</h2>

<p>My first thought was to simply use a CPU for this purpose.  Why not?  The
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
will play a prominent role in the system as it is, and
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
is an easy enough protocol to handle via CPU.  Some might even argue that
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
is a tailor made protocol for a microcontroller implementation.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 2. Problems with building real-time software</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate-i2c/rt-software.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Then I got to thinking about it: CPUs aren’t known for their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing">real time</a>
capabilities.  While it is possible to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing">real time
software</a>, were I to do
so I’d then be stuck with a CPU that could only run one program.  One wrong
tweak to that program and I’d have to re-verify the whole
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing">real time</a> capability
again.  Worse, I’d like to reserve the CPU for ad-hoc development tasks
along the way, and dedicating it to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing">real time</a>
processing task like this would render it unusable for other tasks.</p>

<p>This forces the sensor implementation into the fabric of the FPGA.</p>

<p><strong>CHOICE #1</strong>: A logic based FPGA solution</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the logic required for a hardware based solution is … not
trivial.  Such a solution may need to be reconfigured often during
development, as different sensor configurations are tried and tested until
a final configuration is chosen to deliver to the customer.</p>

<p>The easiest way to build a re-configurable anything is to force the
configuration to be read from memory somewhere: either
<a href="/blog/2018/08/16/spiflash.html">flash</a> or RAM.</p>

<p><strong>CHOICE #2</strong>: The <a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a> logic will be scripted from memory</p>

<p>The next question is, how shall this data be timed?  Specifically, we want
every data packet to start at a timestamp, provided at a regular interval.
This sensor timestamp moreover will need to be synchronized to the data
collection timestamp from the rest of the system.  The idea, therefore, is
that measurement reading will be looped, and the top of the loop starts at
a known time with respect to the rest of the systems timing.</p>

<p><strong>CHOICE #3</strong>: The measurement sequence will start from an external
time–stamped signal</p>

<p>Next design question, how shall the results be reported?</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3. Modifying AXI Stream</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate-i2c/netpkt.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This answer is given by the rest of the design: the results will be reported
via an AXI stream packet output.  If necessary, I’ll might choose to switch to
a modified AXI stream based packet protocol I’m using.  The big difference?
The modified protocol allows for a packet to be aborted if any downstream
component stalls the interface by an amount greater than any buffer within it.
In the absence of any abort conditions, though, it’s simply AXI stream.</p>

<p><strong>CHOICE #4</strong>: Results will be reported via an AXI stream output.</p>

<p>Given these few choices, it’s now fairly easy to outline the form of the design.</p>

<h2 id="outlining-the-design">Outlining the design</h2>

<p>With this information, I can now outline the form this design will take in
Fig. 4 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4. I2C System Diagram</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate-i2c/controller.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>From this standpoint, it looks a lot like a special purpose CPU.</p>

<p>The first step will be to reuse a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilfetch.v">ZipCPU instruction
fetch</a> component.
From here, a small state machine can handle everything else.</p>

<p>Indeed, I’ve now applied this approach to several projects, with generally
great success.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I have a SONAR transmitter design that can send a scripted SONAR waveform
from memory.</p>

    <p>In this case, the transmitter can accept instructions from either the
instruction fetch or from a slave interface.  The instructions consist of
4’bit register addresses, and 28’bit values, some with side effects.  This
allows the CPU to either control the transmitter directly, or to give it a
script to run from.</p>

    <p>Instructions consist of things like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Setting the amplitude</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Setting an optional chirp rate, for linear FM support.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Setting the frequency.  A non-zero frequency will turn the transmitter on.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Waiting for a period of time, or perhaps for an external synchronization
interrupt.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Turning off the transmitter.  In this case, setting a zero frequency
will turn the transmitter off.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Using this approach, the transmitter can generate basic tones,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp_spectrum#Linear_chirp">linear FM</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying">BPSK</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying">BFSK</a> signals, and
even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp_compression">hyperbolic FM</a>
signals.  The design is not only easy to build, low in logic cost, but
it’s easy to verify as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilfetch.v">instruction
fetch</a>
approach has also been a very successful part of an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axisgdma.v">AXI scatter-gather DMA
design</a> I have.
In this design, a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axisgfsm.v">small
FSM</a>
(170 6-LUTs) processes the scatter-gather “table”, as it comes from the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilfetch.v">CPU
fetch</a>
controller.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>When the DMA is not in use, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilfetch.v">instruction fetch</a>
is held in its reset state.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axisgfsm.v">FSM</a>
is then initialized with an address provided over an AXI-lite slave
interface.  This address is then fed to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilfetch.v">instruction
fetch</a>
as if the CPU waas jumping to a new address.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As table values are received, they are written to the DMA via the DMA’s
<a href="/blog/2020/03/08/easyaxil.html">AXI-lite control
interface</a>.  This
includes the source address, destination
address, DMA length, and potentially any options to be given to the DMA,
such as generating an interrupt or continuing in spite of any error–all
coming from the table entry.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Two bits are stolen from each source address in the table.  These bits
control whether the table entry is a normal DMA entry record, whether it
is the last one in the list, whether it is to be skipped, or whether the
address is a link (i.e. pointer) to another table entry elsewhere in
memory.</p>

        <p>Skipping entries, or jumping to a new address is again handled like a
CPU branch instruction.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>One unique feature of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilfetch.v">instruction
fetch</a>
that implements a table in this manner is that you do not want any form of
instruction cache.  Unlike the CPU, where an instruction cache is
highly desirable, applications like those above operate on memory that may
have just changed, so a cache only gets in the way.  Not only that, unlike a
CPU, table memory like this is typically only going to be read once–so, again,
a cache wouldn’t help here.</p>

<p>I should also point out that, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilfetch.v">ZipCPU’s instruction AXI-lite
fetch</a>
has been specifically tested with 8–bit instructions–even though the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
doesn’t have 8–bit instructions.  This is one of the reasons why.</p>

<p>That’s the first step.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 5. Proposed I2C Controller Instruction Set</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate-i2c/insn-list.svg" alt="" width="180" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The second step is to decide on an “instruction set”.  Ten instructions
will be sufficient for our purposes here.  Each instruction can fit in eight
bits, with only the SEND and JUMP instructions requiring subsequent immediate
values.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>CATCH</strong>:  I’m not (yet) certain what to call this instruction.  My notes
currently call it an ABORT instruction, but CATCH might capture it better.
The idea is that this instruction sets the address to jump to should a
data write request ever fail to receive an ACK–sort of like the “catch” half
of a try-catch block in C++ or Java.  Likewise, if for some reason
arbitration is lost, this catch instruction would set the address we’d
return to.</p>

    <p>If I choose to use my modified AXI stream based packet protocol, either of
these conditions would cause the outgoing packet to be aborted as well.
That way the downstream packet receiver can know that the packet is being
restarted from the top.  Without this ABORT signal, the only way to know
that a NAK or loss of <a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
arbitration happened would be to receive a packet of the wrong
length–knowing that the final (known packet-length) bytes would be correct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>WAIT</strong>:  This instruction will cause the
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a> FSM to wait for an external
synchronization signal.  This is how I intend to synchronize this
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a> controller with the rest of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a> frame.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>START</strong>: Now we get to more regular
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
instructions.  This particular one will send an
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
start condition.  If the interface isn’t idle, then it will cause a
repeated start condition to be sent across the interface.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>**SEND <DATA>**:  This command would cause the following byte in the
instruction stream to be "sent" over the interface.  This would include the
first byte of any [I2C](https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification) transaction.
Similarly, many read transactions require an address to be sent following
the first byte, before sending a repeated start and receiving data, and that
address could be sent via a SEND command.  Finally, this command would be
very useful when sending the known and pre-determined configuration to the
device.</DATA></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RXK (RX w/ ACK)</strong>: Receive a byte of data, and ACK (acknowledge) the byte
upon completion.  This will signal to the slave that another byte is yet to
be received following this one.  Once received, the byte will be placed on
the output AXI stream packet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RXN (RX w/ NAK)</strong>: Receive a byte of data, and NAK (negative acknowledge)
the result.  This will signal to the
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
slave that this is the last byte to be requested.  As before, the byte
received will be placed into an output AXI stream packet.  (As an option
I’m considering, this might also send a STOP command.  It just depends on
how complex I want to make the state machine.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RXLK</strong> and <strong>RXLN</strong>:  These two instructions mirror the RXK and RXN
instructions above.  They will receive a byte of data and either ACK or NAK
the result, while also sending the received byte downstream.  The
difference between these two and their previous counterparts is that these
two instructions will set the TLAST field in the AXI stream output.  The
result is that this byte will be marked as the last byte in the outgoing
AXI stream <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a> packet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>STOP</strong>: Send an <a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
stop condition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>JUMP &lt;ADDRESS&gt;</strong>: This is the only other instruction, aside from the SEND
instruction, that gets followed by an immediate address.  In this case, the
immediate bytes contain a system memory bus address to jump to.</p>

    <p>In general, the controller would JUMP to the WAIT instruction at the top of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a> packet, but having
a specific JUMP instruction allows for more options–such as if the loop
includes multiple WAIT instructions.  Either way, since this instruction
set has no ability for a conditional jump, the only type of loop this
instruction set will support is an infinite loop.  Also, since I’ve provided
no HALT instruction in this list, the controller will always enter into
an infinite loop.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many other instructions I could have added, but the application
described above doesn’t require any more.  For example, I could have
implemented a wait-timer instruction with a two, three, or even four byte wait
counter.  Were I expecting bus contention, I might also consider creating an
instruction sequence for a more fine grained checkpoint-restart capability,
so that collisions could properly be recovered from.  In this case, I don’t
expect any other masters on the bus, so I see no need for such instructions
yet.</p>

<p>For now, lets take a quick look at what an instruction stream might look
like that uses this instruction set.</p>

<p>First, it would start with a CATCH instruction, followed by whatever
instructions are necessary to configure the various sensors.
Often, writing to a sensor simply consists of a series of bytes to be sent
to the sensor.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">	CATCH	; Return here following any protocol errors
	; Then, for each sensor
	START
	SEND	(sensor ID)
	SEND	(sensor value address)
	SEND	(config sensor value #1)
	SEND	(config sensor value #2)
	SEND	(config sensor value #3)
	; etc.
	STOP
	; Now repeat the above for the next sensor
	; ... etc.</code></pre></figure>

<p>Once all of the sensors have been configured, we can then switch to the
operational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a> loop.  This
will start with a second CATCH instruction, followed by a WAIT instruction
to wait for the top of the loop.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">	CATCH	; Return here following any protocol errors
loop:
	WAIT	; Wait here for an external synchronization signal</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now it’s time to read from each sensor.  Here’s a typical interaction to read
three bytes from a given sensor.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">	START
	SEND	&lt;sensor ID&gt;	; Which sensor ID do we wish to read from?
	SEND	&lt;address&gt;	; Which address w/in sensor to read from
	START			; Send a repeated start condition
	RXK			; Read byte #1
	RXK			; Read byte #2
	RXK			; Read byte #3
	RXN			; Read byte #4, last byte
	STOP</code></pre></figure>

<p>Not all sensors need addresses, however.  Some sensors have only one value
to be read.  In the following example, the sensor requires no address, yet
provides the last three bytes of the sequence.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">	START
	SEND	&lt;sensor ID&gt;	; Which sensor ID do we wish to read from?
	START			; Send a repeated start condition
	RXK			; Read byte #1
	RXK			; Read byte #2
	RXLN			; Read byte #3, last byte of the telemetry pkt
	STOP
	JUMP			; Return to the top of our loop above.</code></pre></figure>

<p>At least, this is my design idea for this problem.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above, I’ve been pleasantly surprised at the number of ways I’ve
found to use a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilfetch.v">generic, cache-less, CPU instruction fetch
module</a>.
This one capability has repaid me in reuse spades multiple times over with
each application I’ve used it on: scatter gather DMAs, SONAR transmit waveform
encoding, and now my draft design for an ultimate
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
controller listed above.</p>

<p>Reality, however, is that very few problems will limit themselves to a set
of only <a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a> sensors.  The actual
problem this design was drawn from is no different.  It includes not only
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a> sensors, but also multiple
SPI sensors–all of which when put together will make for a very diverse
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry">telemetry</a> sensor set.  Still,
this same approach should also work well for scripting complex SPI sensor
interactions together.</p>

<p>Looking over my instruction set again in hind sight, I’m tempted to split the
JUMP instruction into two parts.  The first part might be an instruction to
set the JUMP target address, and the second part would be the JUMP instruction
itself.  This would not only simplify instruction decoding, but it would also
make the instruction sequence easier to relocate to any address in
memory–without needing to go back and fix up the jump address once a
memory location was assigned to the script.</p>

<p>One missing component of the above explanation is the bus slave component.
In this example, as with all of my examples, I like to make controllers
like this controllable.  Things that an external controller might do
include: interrupting the script and halting the controller, issuing ad-hoc
(scriptless) commands, adjusting the
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a> clock timing, and replacing the
script with another script.  An external CPU might also decide to issue
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
commands via direct bit banging–should such a capability be implemented.
Don’t forget, as well, that if these sensor commands are kept in some kind of
<a href="/blog/2018/08/16/spiflash.html">flash memory</a>, then
the controller would need to be shut down in order to erase or program the
<a href="/blog/2018/08/16/spiflash.html">flash memory</a>.</p>

<p>A second missing component from the design above is the internal logic
analyzer.  Let’s just say that, because of a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/doc/examples/hdmi-eddc/">bad
experience</a>
with a prior <a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a> controller, the
internal logic analyzer connection will be a minimum requirement of any new
implementation.  The problem I had before with the last
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a> controller, was that a bug in
the controller tended to leave the interface mid-transaction.  When I then came
back later and reloaded the FPGA or otherwise reset the design, the
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a>
bus interaction didn’t reset–the slave remained mid-ACK and wouldn’t release
the data wire.  The (compressed) logic analyzer was necessary to diagnose the
problem, and bit banging over the bus was necessary to fix it.  Although this
only lasted until I found my bug, it has left me cautious when designing
<a href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/specification">I2C</a> controllers.</p>
