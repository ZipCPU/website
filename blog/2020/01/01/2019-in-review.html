    <p>It’s a new year!  Let’s continue our end-of-year tradition from
<a href="/blog/2018/01/01/top-ten.html">2017</a>
and <a href="/blog/2018/01/01/top-ten.html">2018</a>
and take a moment to look back over 2019, from the
perspective of the ZipCPU blog, and see what stands out.</p>

<h2 id="blog-history">Blog History</h2>

<p>If you aren’t familiar with the back story, I started the ZipCPU blog back
in 2017.  Back then, times were tough.  It had only been four years since
starting <a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist
Technology</a>,
and contacts and jobs were drying up.</p>

<p>Did I know what I was doing when I began
<a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">Gisselquist Technology</a>
back in 2013?  While we can argue about whether I understood digital design
back then, I clearly did not understand business.  I knew it too.</p>

<p>Prior to 2017, I’d had a couple of gift jobs: friends I knew who just happened
to have just the right job for me.  At one time, I remember traveling to visit
my mother and then visited some friends who worked nearby.  These friends asked
me to come visit them at the office, during business hours, and so I found
myself walking into a meeting where the foregone conclusion was that they
wanted me to do a job for them.</p>

<p>This is what I consider a “gift”–not because it isn’t valid work, nor because
there’s anything untoward going on, but simply because I was the right person
for the job at the right time.  I walked into someone else’s need.  Such jobs
are <em>gifts</em> from the Almighty.</p>

<p>That said, it’s hard to plan on gifts, and I needed to learn how to find
business the hard way.</p>

<p>My original approach to business development was to build a portfolio of
digital designs on <a href="https://opencores.org">OpenCores</a>, and then use them
as discussion pieces on various digital forums.  Indeed, they made great
example designs for that purpose.  That said, this approach wasn’t bringing
in any business (at the time).  (I’ve since gotten several contracts from
this work.)</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig. 1.  Inbound Marketing</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/inbound-marketing.jpeg" alt="" width="240" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Then, in May of 2017 my aunt came to visit.  She took the whole family to
the local used book store to pick out gifts that were to be from Grandma–who
was getting too frail to visit everyone.  At the time, I picked up a book
titled, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inbound-Marketing-Found-Google-Social/dp/0470499311">Inbound
Marketing: Get Found using Google, Social Media, and
Blogs</a>.
I had heard of inbound marketing before, and the concept appealed to me.
Instead of cold calling prospective customers promoting my work, I’d promote
my work and capabilities on a blog to the extent that prospective customers
would contact me about what they wanted done, and I could make contacts that
way.</p>

<p>The idea appealed to me, so I started up <a href="https://zipcpu.com">zipcpu.com</a>
and started writing blog articles.  I also started creating a <a href="https://twitter.com/ZipCPU">twitter
feed</a>–all at the suggestion of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inbound-Marketing-Found-Google-Social/dp/0470499311">Inbound
Marketing</a> book.</p>

<p>Thus began the ZipCPU blog.  Since that time, my <a href="https://twitter.com/ZipCPU">twitter
following</a> have grown to over three
thousand.  Wow.  Thanks, everybody!</p>

<h2 id="zipcpu-meets-formal-verification">ZipCPU meets Formal Verification</h2>

<p>Later that year, as I was preparing to head to <a href="https://orconf.org">OrConf</a>
for the second time, Edmund from <a href="https://symbioticeda.com">SymbioticEDA</a>
contacted me.  He wanted me to try out
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>, their new
formal verification tool.</p>

<p>What was I to say?  Did I need formal verification?  Of course not!  Why would
I need some bright new gadget to help me do what I’d been doing already?
What I did need, however, was marketing material for my blog.  So I decided
to condescend and see how this new formal verification tool worked, and then
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">write a blog article about
it</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/pro/11/2">Prov 11:2</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much to my surprise, the formal verification tool taught me some desperately
needed humility.  <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">I applied the formal verification tool to a very basic
design, a simple FIFO that I’d used for years, only to discover it had bugs
in it that were never found by my test
bench</a>.</p>

<p>I then set out to <a href="/blog/2018/01/22/formal-progress.html">formally verify the rest of my
portfolio</a>.  Over and
over I found bugs, sometimes subtle ones, sometimes not so subtle.  I found
bugs in all kinds of places, notably in designs that had passed all of my
test benches: <a href="/zipcpu/2017/12/28/ugliest-bug.html">my prefetch and
cache</a>, <a href="/blog/2018/04/02/formal-cpu-bugs.html">my
CPU</a>,
my SDRAM controller,
<a href="/blog/2019/11/14/sdspi.html">my SD-Card controller</a>, <a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">an
FFT</a> and much more.  Indeed, I’ve
since found so many bugs using formal verification, that I’m not sure I could
go back to what I was doing before–I no longer trust my ability to write
a test bench that would be “good enough”.</p>

<p>This has also made the blog quite unique: In a world where no one discusses
hardware bugs, where bugs get quietly swept under the rug, I was discussing
bugs in my own work.</p>

<p>Yes, I suppose the verse above is worth repeating.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/pro/11/2">Prov 11:2</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="formal-verification-meets-axi">Formal Verification meets AXI</h2>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig. 2.  AXI uses 5 channels, any of which can stall</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/bus-axi-channels.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>While most of my designs used a <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone
bus</a>, every now and
again <a href="/blog/2019/04/27/axi-addr.html">I needed something using
AXI</a>.  So, back in late
2018, I started building a set of formal properties that could be used to
verify an AXI component–much like the <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">formal properties I’d already used for
verifying my Wishbone
components</a>.</p>

<p>As with any project, I started off simple and just looked at
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>.  Unlike the full
AXI protocol, AXI-lite doesn’t have nearly as many signals to it, and so it
was fairly easy to work with.  I began simply  with the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/doc/busprops.pdf">four basic bus
properties</a>
I had learned to use when working with
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Following a reset, everything should return to idle.</li>
  <li>When a request is stalled, its details shouldn’t be changed</li>
  <li>There shall be no responses without prior requests, and</li>
  <li>All requests get responses.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are pretty basic, and in the case of
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-lite</a>
they weren’t all that hard to write out.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig. 3.  Xilinx's 2016.3 AXI-lite demonstration design drops write acknowledgments.  Fixed by 2018.3</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/xilinx-axil/axil-xilinx-write-fail.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>I then looked around for a working design to try my new properties on.  It
didn’t take too long before I found <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">Xilinx’s demonstration
designs</a>.  Much to
my surprise, I found bugs.  The core would drop transaction responses,
as shown in Fig’s 3 and 4 where, with just a little bit of back pressure,
the second request’s response would get dropped.</p>

<p>The presumption, of course, was that my brand-new, untested <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_slave.v">formal bus
properties</a>
were broken.  This would be the only sensible conclusion.  The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/xlnxdemo.v">Xilinx
design</a>
I was trying to verify had been around for years.  It had been used by many
Xilinx customers.  Indeed, you’d expect the bugs to have been worked out of
them by the time I started working with them.</p>

<p>So I dug into the demonstration designs to see what was going on.  Again to
my surprise, I was able to verify that the bugs the formal tool found
were indeed valid.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig. 4.  Xilinx's 2016.3 demonstration AXI-Lite drops read acknowledgments.  Bug remains in 2019.1</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/xilinx-axil/axil-xilinx-read-fail.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>While this took place in late 2018, this was really the start of what I’m
going to call, the <em>year when AXI met formal</em>.</p>

<p>My surprise at <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">finding bugs in Xilinx’s AXI-lite
core</a> only intensified when
one of Xilinx’s engineer’s contacted me to explain that not returning a
response to a transaction wasn’t a bug, since the response might yet be
returned later.  Indeed, from just looking at Fig’s 3 and 4 you might not
catch that the trace ends in a <em>steady state</em>!  However, if you looked at the
core, you could tell that the response had been dropped and would never be
returned.</p>

<p>I then had to explain to them that this was their IP core I had found bugs in,
and not my own.  Unfortunately, this took more explaining than I was expecting.
Yes, I had modified the core: I had adjusted the white space, removed white
space from the ends of lines, and corrected spelling mistakes in the comments.
No, the logic wasn’t modified, etc.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig. 5. The formal property file makes checking even the code of others easy</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/tweets/brken-axilite.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Of course, from this point out things only got easier for me.  You see, now
that I had a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_slave.v">formal property file describing an AXI-lite
interface</a>,
testing and checking other cores became routine.  With this property set,
plus the <a href="https://www.symbioticeda.com/seda-suite">Symbiotic EDA Suite</a>,
I could now take any AXI-lite design, Verilog, VHDL, or even System Verilog,
posted to any forum, attach <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_slave.v">my property
file</a>,
and verify that the bus interface to such a core was (or was not)
working—even before I understood all of the details of how the core was
supposed to work.  Several cores were forwarded to me at that time to verify.
Almost all were  broken, and worse <em><a href="/formal/2019/04/16/axi-mistakes.html">most were broken in the same
way</a></em>.  The most
notable exception was an <a href="https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl/hdl/library/common/up_axi.v">Analog Devices
core</a>–a
pleasant surprise along the way since it <em>just worked</em> unlike the other cores
I had been checking.</p>

<p>Now that I had <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_slave.v">my own formal property
file</a>,
I could do more than check the properties of others, I could now <a href="/formal/2019/01/12/demoaxilite.html">build my own
AXI-lite slave core</a>
as well.  At this point, it was easy to do.  Fig. 6 shows the kind of
throughput I was able to achieve on the write channel,</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig. 6. AXI-lite demonstration, showing 100% write throughput</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/xilinx-axil/axil-demo-write.svg"><img src="/img/xilinx-axil/axil-demo-write.svg" alt="" width="780" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>and Fig. 7 shows the performance on the write channel.  In both cases, I was
able to achieve 100% throughput–shown at the end of the traces above.
This is in contrast to Xilinx’s demonstration cores which achieved only 50%
throughput in Vivado 2016.3 (less in 2018.3) and many of Xilinx’s AXI full IP
cores.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig. 7. AXI-lite demonstration, showing 100% write throughput</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/xilinx-axil/axil-demo-read.svg"><img src="/img/xilinx-axil/axil-demo-read.svg" alt="" width="780" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>I then turned my attention to building a full AXI4 property set, rather than
just the AXI-Lite version.</p>

<p>AXI4 was much more of a challenge to formally verify, and that for a couple of
reasons.  First, the IDs make things challenging.  An AXI slave is allowed to
return transactions in any order, as long as all of the transactions associated
with a given ID are returned in order.  Second, the burst lengths are a
challenge.  In particular, it can be a challenge to verify that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RLAST</code>
signal is properly set after two or more read address requests have been
accepted.  In any implementation, a FIFO would fix this kind of problem nicely.
Indeed, AXI processing and FIFOs work well together.  This of course led
to the third problem: verifying properties of the output of a
FIFO can be quite a challenge.</p>

<p>When designing an AXI component, these various constraints aren’t really all
that hard to deal with.  The various transaction information may be placed
into FIFOs within the slave, and dealt with accordingly–but how shall these
extra properties be handled in the context of <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">formal
induction</a>?</p>

<p>If you haven’t worked with
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
before, you should at least know that
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
has its own particular challenges.  In particular, the formal engine will
start in the middle of time–with your design already in some state.  Only
your assertions and to some extent your assumptions will hold that state
consistent.   While it is possible to provide assertions to describe
every item in a FIFO, it’s typically an expensive and challenging thing to do.
But without doing this, it would be easy for the design and the formal
properties to get into an inconsistent state.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig. 8. Xilinx's 2018.3 AXI4 demonstration design didn't guarantee the right return ID</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/axifull/axifull-rdid.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>With some help from Clifford, I managed to put a set of AXI properties
together.</p>

<p>As before, I first turned to one of <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">Xilinx’s demonstration
cores</a> to test my
properties.  Again, to my surprise, <a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">Xilinx’s demonstration AXI4 (full) IP was
also broken</a>.</p>

<p>First, it didn’t guarantee the right packet ID would be returned on either
read (Fig 8) or write channels.  Second, the write channel couldn’t handle
backpressure as shown in Fig. 9.</p>

<p>This left me somewhat perplexed.  <a href="/formal/2019/09/06/axi-story.html">How could such example designs have been
broken for so long</a>?
Indeed, Xilinx was using their examples in all of their training material.
Surely these examples would’ve been important for them to get right?</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 9. Xilinx's core can't handle backpressure</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/axifull/axifull-bvalid-fail.svg"><img src="/img/axifull/axifull-bvalid-fail.svg" alt="" width="560" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>After a bit of digging, I discovered reports of AXI designs that would hang
dating back several years.  Customers trusted Xilinx’s demo designs, and so
believed the bugs were elsewhere–but then struggled to find the problem
that was causing their design to lock up.  Forum moderators typically blamed
customer designs, since no one was able to reproduce the bugs in a test-bench.
Not only that, but not all interconnect configurations or transaction
combinations would trigger the bugs.  Many of the more common interconnect
configurations wouldn’t trigger the bugs at all.  However, if you then
switched configurations, the bug would get triggered and you’d end up looking
in the wrong place.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 10. Xilinx's 2018.3 AXI4 demonstration design checks for WLAST without also checking for WVALID.  As a result, WREADY gets dropped before the transaction is complete</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/axifull/axifull-wlast.svg"><img src="/img/axifull/axifull-wlast.svg" alt="" width="490" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>I then discovered that Xilinx would <a href="/formal/2019/09/06/axi-story.html">delete forum posts of dissatisfied
customers, or of posters who would complain of broken
infrastructure</a>.  Indeed,
Fig. 11 shows a comment recommending the use of formal methods, the only
method that has so far found these sorts of bugs, that Xilinx deleted from
their forums.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 11. Xilinx deletes posts that would lead you to their bugs</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/tweets/xilinx-deleted-recommending-formal-tools.png" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>No wonder why the bugs went so long without ever getting fixed.</p>

<p>During this time, I had the opportunity to speak with Xilinx’s representatives
as well.  Thankfully, they (eventually) acknowledged the faults in their
demonstration cores.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 12. Xilinx's core checks for WLAST without also checking for WVALID</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/tweets/xilinx-demarco-acknowledges.png"><img src="/img/tweets/xilinx-demarco-acknowledges.png" alt="" width="780" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>Xilinx’s explanation was that these “IP Packager” cores, the ones I call
their demonstration cores, came from an uncertain open source origin and
were never placed under Xilinx configuration management, and so they were
never verified along with the cores Xilinx considers their IP.  I was then
assured that Xilinx’s proper IP cores would never have these problems.
Those were verified by a “best in class” verification methodology (not formal)
every night, so I could rest assured that these other cores were bug free.
No, this “best in class” verification methodology did not use their
AXI VIP.  (I asked.)  Apparently, they didn’t even trust their own Verification
IP for this purpose.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left"><caption>Fig 13. Intel's demo core also checks WLAST without also checking WVALID and WREADY</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/axi-intel/axi-intel-wlast.svg"><img src="/img/axi-intel/axi-intel-wlast.svg" alt="" width="490" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>I didn’t stop with Xilinx, however.  I checked out Intel’s demonstration core
too.  This one was an AXI3 core, and so not quite the type of AXI4 core my
properties had been built to handle.  On the other hand, if you limited the
proof to looking at one ID only, then it wasn’t hard to use the same properties
for both.</p>

<p>Just like Xilinx’s demonstration core, Intel’s was broken as well–in multiple
places.  Fig. 13 shows a burst request, attempting to send <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AWLEN+1</code> or two
words of data, but where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BVALID</code> is set high before the second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WDATA</code> element
was received.  Not only that, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WREADY</code> was dropped.  Like the Xilinx bugs
above, this would likely cause the design to freeze.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only bug.  Fig. 14 shows an example where just a little bit
of back-pressure from the first burst would cause Intel’s core to drop the
second response.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 14. Intel's demo core can't handle backpressure on BREADY either</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/axi-intel/axi-intel-bvalid.svg"><img src="/img/axi-intel/axi-intel-bvalid.svg" alt="" width="560" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>The story didn’t stop there, however.  Now that I had a formal property set
to describe AXI4 transactions, I could verify just about any AXI4 interface.
Doing so was as easy as creating a wrapper for the design in question, attaching
the formal property set and the core in question to the wrapper, and then
running the formal tools.  Running the test rarely required more than a lot
of typing.</p>

<p>As an example, I recently applied the
<a href="https://www.symbioticeda.com/seda-suite">Symbiotic EDA Suite</a>,
to <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/axi_ethernetlite.html">Xilinx’s AXI Ethernet-Lite IP
core</a>.  Here’s what I discovered:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contrary to <a href="/doc/axi-spec.pdf#page=41">spec</a>, Xilinx’s
RVALID logic requires RREADY to be set</li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 15. Xilinx's Ethernet-Lite, RVALID depends upon RREADY</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/xilinx-axi-ethernetlite-axi_rvalid.png"><img src="/img/xilinx-axi-ethernetlite/axi_rvalid.png" alt="" width="511" /></a></td></tr></table>

<ol start="2">
  <li>This means that the design will hang if the interconnect doesn’t hold
RREADY high during any read request</li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 16. Xilinx's Ethernet-Lite, reads will never set RVALID if !RREADY</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/xilinx-axi-ethernetlite/axi_rvalidtrace.png"><img src="/img/xilinx-axi-ethernetlite/axi_rvalidtrace.png" alt="" width="780" /></a></td></tr></table>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Not only will the design hang waiting for the master to raise <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RREADY</code>, but
it will also accept new requests during this time.  The resulting returns
might then have the wrong <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RID</code>.  Fig. 17, for example, shows a request
of length <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARLEN+1</code> or one data value using ID <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3'b101</code>.  The response
then comes back with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RID</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3'b100</code>–an error, since the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3'b100</code>
response needed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8'h91</code> values before getting a return with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RLAST</code> set.</li>

<ol start="4">
  <li>Returns might even be given the wrong <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RLAST</code>.  While Fig. 17 hinted at this
problem, you can see it clearly in Fig. 18 below.  In this case, two requests
are made for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARID=3'b000</code>.  The first request is for a single beat, the
second for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1+8'h3E</code> beats.  However, when the core responds to the first
request, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RLAST</code> is still low.  The cause?  Primarily the simple fact that
this core can’t handle backpressure.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
  <li>If all of that wasn’t bad enough, writes accepted at the same time reads
are accepted will <em>write their values to the address given on the read
channel.</em>  You can see this by examining the code from their design.

  <li>To keep this from happening, their design prohibits reads during writes and

<p>Apparently, Xilinx’s professional “best in class” AXI property checker
doesn’t include a formal property check.  Just like my own <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">first experiences
with formal methods</a>,
they’ve now been burned by designs that passed a test bench without being
specification compliant.</p>

<p>I’ve also applied formal methods to their <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/axi_bram_ctrl/v4_0/pg078-axi-bram-ctrl.pdf">Block RAM
controller</a>.  Along the way I discovered that it
could only handle reads or writes, never both at the same time–despite the
fact that AXI has channels for both.  (This seems like a common theme, no?)
Not only that, but <a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">my own example
design</a> achieved better
throughput on single channels.  Here’s their best block RAM read performance,
requiring <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N+3</code> clocks to read <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> elements.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 21. Xilinx's block RAM controller, requires N+3 clocks to read N elements</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/xilinx-bram-ctrl/read-burst.png" alt="" width="746" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Poor burst performance wasn’t limited to reads, but also affected the write
channel as well.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 22. Xilinx's block RAM controller, requires N+3 clocks to read N elements</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/xilinx-bram-ctrl/write-burst.png" alt="" width="746" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Let’s now think this through.  These bugs were found within just a few of
Xilinx’s IP cores where they’ve publicly posted their design code.  How many
bugs would you now expect from IP that hasn’t been posted publicly?</p>

<p>This is where and why open source becomes so important.  When the design source
is open, you can verify the existence of any bugs on your own.</p>

<p>To this end, I’ve also managed to verify and demonstrate several <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip">IP cores of
my own</a> using this AXI4 property set as
well:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">An AXI Crossbar</a></li>
  <li>
    <p>Data movers:
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/aximm2s.v">AXIMM2S</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axis2mm.v">AXIS2MM</a>.</p>

    <p>These two are my own.  They bare no internal resemblance to Xilinx’s
(encrypted) data mover cores–or shall I say they bare no resemblance that
I am aware of.</p>

    <p>No, I haven’t verified Xilinx’s data movers as either working on not.
Unlike their data movers, 1) these two cores work within Verilator, and
2) they can both achieve a 100% AXI throughput.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axi2axilite.v">An AXI to AXI-lite
bridge</a>.
Better yet, an AXI to AXI-lite bridge that gets 100% throughput–meaning you
can write an AXI-lite slave that can still process AXI transactions without
slowing down.</li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: center"><caption>Fig 23. Read performance of my own AXI to AXI-Lite bridge</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/tweets/axi2axil-read-burst.png" alt="" width="940" /></td></tr></table>

a slave to either be compliant or to be reset.  As a special bonus, the
slave can be reset and re-integrated into the design–without either hanging

</ol>

<p>None of these insights would’ve been possible without either the
<a href="https://www.symbioticeda.com/seda-suite">Symbiotic EDA Suite</a>,
or the formal AXI4 property set for verifying AXI cores.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-tutorial">The New Tutorial</h2>

<p>In the middle of all of this, I also built a <a href="/tutorial">beginners Verilog
tutorial</a>.  My work on this
<a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>
started in 2018, although it took until May of 2019 for me to finish it.  The
<a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>
was initially intended to be something that could be used as a set of
lecture slides for a class.  As a result, it consists of a series of PDF
files and some partially completed (and deliberately broken) homework exercises.</p>

<p>Unlike many other approaches, my own approach doesn’t teach the full Verilog
test-bench syntax.  Instead, I chose to use Verilator and C++ design wrappers.
My reason was simply due to the fact that I’d seen so many students get
confused when attempting to synthesize what should’ve been test-bench only code.</p>

<p>The second big difference with my approach was that I taught how to apply
formal verification to every design, starting in lesson three.</p>

<p>The third big difference was that I tried to be hardware agnostic.  All you
needed was a simulator–in this case, Verilator.  As a bonus, if you had an
FPGA, any FPGA with nothing more than serial port, a button (or switch),
and several LEDs, you could build all of the designs for your board.  Indeed,
I avoided proprietary design components like the plague–in order to keep the
<a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a> fully generic.</p>

<p>The course has been well received, albeit with caveats:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Students with some Verilog background have balked at my liberal usage of
C++ and Makefiles.  Why, they’ve asked, should they be required to learn
a new language?  This is understandable.  On the other hand, students with
more of a software background have likely felt quite at home with this
approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the rest of the industry uses Verilog test benches (or SystemVerilog,
or VHDL …), the <a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>
has often left students either without this valuable skill
or wondering how they should be using it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since I used Verilator and the open version of
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>
for all of the projects, there was no ability to add a parallel VHDL
tutorial.  Many students have asked for one.  This is currently something
that I am unable to provide using free tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because I used PDF files, I can’t track downloads.  This makes it hard to
know if students are really interacting with the
<a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a> itself, or perhaps just the
formal verification courseware slides that are further down on the same
page.  I suppose it doesn’t matter, both would be good things, I’d just
love to know and understand more about my readers.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, several individuals have asked for a course that goes into the next
step–an <a href="/blog/2019/08/16/intermediate.html">intermediate design
course</a>.  Such a
course would teach design in the context of a system with either a
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>
or an AXI-Lite internal bus.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 24. Proposed intermediate tutorial structure</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/im-tutorial/tut-intermediate.svg"><img src="/img/im-tutorial/tut-intermediate.svg" alt="" width="720" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p>At this point, however, my world <a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>
domination plans have gotten slowed down.  Specifically, I want my
<a href="/blog/2019/08/16/intermediate.html">intermediate design
tutorial</a>
to remain vendor agnostic–while still being useful on SOC (FPGA+ARM) chips.
That means that the
<a href="/blog/2019/08/16/intermediate.html">tutorial</a> will need to
teach students how to connect bus components to a design using only open
source tools.</p>

<p>As of today, I think I’ve finally got
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</a> lined up for that purpose.
It now has an (untested, and quite likely buggy) <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga/tree/be56554f65c84a7bed96bec61c2224e53d39c0e4">development
branch</a>
that supports not only <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone
(pipeline)</a>,
but also AXI-lite and AXI–with an appropriate set of <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip">crossbars, bridges,
and bus simplifiers</a> to make certain
things work together properly.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 25. Simplifying SOC component development using Wishbone</caption><tr><td><a href="/img/zynqsoc-axiwb.svg"><img src="/img/zynqsoc-axiwb.svg" alt="" width="560" /></a></td></tr></table>

<p><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15">If the Lord is willing</a>,
I look forward to finally getting some of the lessons associated with this
course written in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="viewership-in-2019">Viewership in 2019</h2>

<p>With all that background aside, it’s now time to turn our attention to some
statistics from 2019.  Care to see how well the blog has done?  As you can
see from the chart below, the ZipCPU blog has really taken off this last year.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 26. 2019 ZipCPU Page Views</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/2019-pageviews.png" alt="" width="720" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Last year, the blog had 183,281 page views.  This year, we’ve had 332,735 page
views.  Readership is definitely up.</p>

<p>Even better, the blog has gone from a maximum of 647 page views per day within
a week, shown on the far left of Fig. 26 above, to 1,984 page views in one day
during one week in December.  This is nearly a three-fold increase in the
number of page views.</p>

<p>If you are new to the blog, then, welcome!</p>

<p>That said, if you want to sell me web software to help my blog get
noticed by the big search engines, then No, Thank you.  The blog is doing
quite nicely on its own.</p>

<p>Another thing to notice that’s fascinating about this chart is that most of
the page views take place between Monday and Friday.  This tells me that the
ZipCPU blog isn’t just read by hobbyists–apparently the professionals
find this information quite relevant as well.</p>

<p>Welcome, professionals!</p>

<p>Third, you’ll notice that readership slowed somewhat during June and July.
Initially, I attributed this to the fact that I was working on so many
contracts that it was difficult to write new articles.  Now, looking over the
months since then, I’m not so sure.  Instead, I’m more tempted to believe that
this slump is due to the end of the school year and either students not
reading the articles, or professionals going on vacation.</p>

<p>Finally, I think that in many ways the reason why the blog took off this year
is because of my AXI work above.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how many
hits the various AXI articles received, as I’ll discuss in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="top-articles-written-in-2019">Top Articles Written in 2019</h2>

<p>Let’s now look at some of the most popular articles from 2019.  As we did
last year, I’ll treat these as a top ten list, and work my way from number
ten (least popular) down to number one (most popular).  I’ll also continue
my tradition of splitting the lists into two.  The first list will consist
of the most popular articles <em>written</em> in 2019, and then in the next section
we’ll look at a list of the most popular articles over all based upon what
was <em>viewed</em> in 2019.</p>

<p>I’ll start with two honorable mentions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/formal/2019/09/06/axi-story.html">AXI Verification, the story so far</a></p>

    <p>While this article didn’t quite break into the 2019 top ten, to me it tells
the <em>story</em> of what’s been going on, told in a way that even a manager might
understand it.  In short, user after user has tried to build an AXI
component, likely following the demonstration guides given them by their
vendor, only to find that their design will suddenly freeze for a reason
they can’t seem to fathom.</p>

    <p>The fact that these bugs were finally found using formal methods should
be a lesson to all.</p>

    <p>This article had 1,018 page views.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/formal/2019/08/03/proof-duration.html">Just how long does a formal proof take to
finish?</a></p>

    <p>A second article to miss the top ten was this neat one on proof durations.
Since I’ve now performed and maintain nearly a thousand proofs, it’s easy
to draw some statistics from them.  Surprisingly, as this article
demonstrates, formal proofs tend to be fairly fast overall–something
worth remembering.</p>

    <p>Of course, the statistic might also be biased by the fact that I always use
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>.
Without
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>,
it’s hard to know how much formal verification is enough.  With it,
proofs can confidently be shortened to a minimum length.</p>

    <p>That said, I’ll let you read more about this yourself if you’d like.</p>

    <p>This is a fascinating article because it walks through the steps I went
through to find a fault within a design where the ZipCPU suddenly froze
mid-program.  It walks through and describes the various tools which can be
used to debug a CPU design, and then discusses how they did (or did not)
help in this case.</p>

    <p>The bug in question was a particularly ugly one too–involving a race
condition between the interrupt line and the compressed instruction word
decoder.  In the end, a watchdog timer connected to an internal logic
analyzer was used to provide evidences of the bug, evidences which were
then be placed into a formal verification context to find the details
surrounding what caused the bug.</p>

<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">Digilent’s</a>

forums include some form of an AXI Interconnect within them.  Indeed, my
own Intel Cyclone-V design starts with the AXI Interconnect output from
the ARM SoC.  These are very vendor dependent interconnects.  They are
proprietary, encrypted, and cannot run under Verilator.</p>

    <p>Building my own interconnect was therefore a necessary part of building
a vendor independent infrastructure.  Sure, I hear the question now, but
aren’t you a vendor?  I suppose you might say that.  However, I’ve posted
the design files for my (unencrypted) interconnect(s) online–so feel free
to use them as you need them.</p>

    <p>Sadly, an interconnect is really too complicated for a blog article.  So,

    <p>AXI has a particular requirement that there can be no combinatorial paths

wires.  The easy way around this is to use a <em>skidbuffer</em>, as discussed in
this article.  Indeed, creating a skid buffer makes building AXI logic so
easy that I’ve since been converting all of my designs so that they use them
explicitly.  If you want to see an example of this, check out the

    <p>After verifying Xilinx’s AXI-lite and AXI (full) demonstration cores, as
well as Intel’s cores, and after looking over several examples of on-line
cores, it quickly became apparent that the same bug was being replicated
across many designs.  This article discusses that bug, showing how it may
easily be spotted, and how to adjust your design so it doesn’t have that
bug.</p>

    <p>It’s not enough to just criticize the IP of others, at some point you need
to generate your own.  This article discusses how to generate an AXI4
slave.  It also introduces my own goal for AXI based designs: 100%
throughput without stalling between requests.  This is better than the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N+3</code> (burst length plus 3 clocks) performance of <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/axi_bram_ctrl/v4_0/pg078-axi-bram-ctrl.pdf">Xilinx’s block RAM
controller</a>,
while also offering concurrent read and write performance.</p>

    <p>Since writing this example, I’ve added <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip">several more of my designs to this
mix</a>–all with the same design goal:
100% throughput across burst boundaries.  I’ll admit, getting the data
movers to meet this standard was a challenge, but all very possible using
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>
together with the formal property set mentioned above.</p>

    <p>Sadly, many new FPGA designers want to know how they can build AXI4
components as well.  Having read this article, they’ve often complained
that it is too difficult to understand.  At this point, I’m at a loss:
is my development really that complicated?  Or is the problem the simple
reality that the AXI protocol <em>is</em> a complicated protocol?  Do I blame
Xilinx for choosing AXI, when other protocols such as
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>
are so much simpler?  Or should I blame a problem on unreasonable
expectations?</p>

    <p>Let’s face it: AXI is hard.  Building bug-free AXI components is not
something many <em>professionals</em> are good at, much less brand new students
and hobbyists.  This should be well evidenced by AXI bugs listed above, bugs
that I found this year–even in code that had been verified by a professional
“best in class” AXI verification methodology.</p>

    <p>What if I just want an example design I can start from?  Such a design is
provided by the article above.  Enjoy it!</p>

    <p>While technically not a 2019 article, my first AXI-lite article deserves an
honorable mention in this list.  This is the article that first pointed out
the bugs in Xilinx’s AXI-lite demonstration core.  It has been placed here
in rank order, where it would fall if it were 2019 article.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, my page views per year metric of articles written in the
same year doesn’t treat articles written late in the year fairly.  As a
result, this article didn’t score well in the few remaining days of year it
was written, and so <a href="/blog/2019/01/01/top-ten.html">didn’t make the list last
year</a>.  An honorable
mention is therefore all the more appropriate for this article.</p>

    <p>Holding the number two spot for the year among articles written this year,
is an article on building an AXI-lite slave core.  This follows from the
AXI-lite formal property set article that just received honorable mention,
and discusses how to build (and verify) an AXI-lite core.  This core is
special among many AXI-lite cores in that 1) it’s fully verified, unlike
the other examples out there, and 2) it can achieve 100% throughput on
both read and write channels.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the name doesn’t do any justice to the article.  It’s not
a flashy name.  Of course you’d want to build a <em>Custom yet Functional</em>
AXI-lite slave!  Who wouldn’t want to build such?  The name, however, stands
in contrast to Xilinx’s demonstration IP core which was clearly broken.</p>

    <p>Since building this first design, I’ve had to build other AXI-lite designs,
such as those for my data movers discussed above.  Using the skidbuffers
made building these designs so much easier, that I may come back later and
rewrite this article showing how simple a full-featured AXI-lite slave
component can be to write.</p>

Addressing</a></p>

    <p>Finally, in the number one spot, is an article on AXI addressing.  Unlike
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>,
AXI has several extra addressing signals which can be used to capture the
width of a request.  Wires like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AxSIZE</code>, for example, can be used to ensure
that AXI transactions can go through resizing modules without any loss
of information.</p>

    <p>That said, all that extra functionality comes with a cost in terms of
complexity.  This article works its way through the design of a
“next-address” calculator that works across sizes, across unaligned address
requests, fixed, incrementing, or wrapped burst addressing and more.</p>

    <p>This “next-address” calculator has since formed a core part of many of my
subsequent AXI designs.  With little more than the inclusion of <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axi_addr.v">this
core</a>, it’s
easy to create a core with “Narrow Burst” support.</p>

    <p><a href="/gun-control.html">Why more gun control won’t solve our
problems</a></p>

    <p>This blog is not about Gun Control.  It is about avoiding FPGA Hell through
proper design and verification.  While I have promised a certain number of
articles on Christianity and/or professional ethics, this doesn’t really fit
either category.  However, this particular article needs an honorable
mentions if for no other reason than the number of page views it
has received this year.</p>

    <p>So how does an article on gun-control make its way to a blog on FPGAs?
It started on twitter.  As the conversation on twitter continued, it became
apparent that I would likely struggle to present my case one tweet at a time.
Worse, I found myself in the regrettable position of irritating my FPGA
twitter followers who weren’t interested in a discussion of gun policy.
Therefore, in order to try to make a graceful exit from this situation, I
wrote down my views and evidences into this article back in Feb 19, 2018.</p>

    <p>Because the blog isn’t focused on gun control, I never linked to this article
anywhere but in a single tweet.  Today, this article comes in the
surprising #11 position of all time popular articles viewed in 2019.</p>

    <p>The Spartan 6 LX4 is a <em>small</em> FPGA.  Digilent sold it as part of their
CMod S6 carrier module board.  My goal when purchasing this design was
to see if I could get the ZipCPU to run on this board.  Logic was
tight–there was no room a debug bus.  In spite of all of this,
the ZipCPU demonstrated the ability to run a multi-tasking system.</p>

    <p>This article, coming in at #10, was all about what it took to get the logic
resource usage down low enough that the ZipCPU could successfully fit 
into this design.</p>

    <p>What’s not said or discussed here is that CORDIC’s are relatively expensive,
in terms of both computation and latency, especially when you want to get a
lot of bits of precision and hardware multiplies are available to you.  As
a result, I may come back to this topic and discuss how to generate a
better, cleaner, sinewave for less logic later.</p>

    <p><a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">Building a Simple Logic PLL</a></p>

    <p>Digital data transmission requires a clock.  In <a href="/about/gisselquist-technology.html">my own
experience</a>, that
clock is often embedded within the data waveform itself and needs to be
recovered.  A PLL forms one common approach to this recovering such a clock.</p>

    <p>There are a couple of ways to implement a PLL in logic.  The classic method
requires a CORDIC, a multiply, some filtering–and lots of clock ticks.
All this logic comes at a cost impacting the PLLs ability to quickly track
and lock to any incoming clock signal.</p>

    <p>This article discusses a means of creating a PLL in logic but without
the sinewave generator or the multiply.  The result is a simple PLL,
using little more than adds and subtracts, but yet one that is still
very effective at clock tracking.  What the article doesn’t discuss is
the math required to get the tracking coefficients right.  I may yet come
back and explain that in a future article.</p>

    <p>… and then there’s my FIFO article.  This was written before I started

longer trust either this article or the implementation within it.  Most

    <p>The number one web request across the entire ZipCPU blog during 2019 was for
my Verilog tutorial page.</p>

    <p>I’d like to say of a certainty that this was due to the Verilog tutorial
itself.  Sadly, due to the fact that the tutorial is written as a set of
PDF files, and the fact that Google Analytics doesn’t track PDF viewing
very well, I have no idea whether these web hits are to which lesson, which
lesson might be confusing, or if these are to my formal courseware slides.</p>

    <p>This may mean that I need to restructure this page in the future.</p>

    <p>For now, I’ll let it simply mean that my tutorial page is well loved.</p>
