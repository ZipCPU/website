<p>The concept is pretty simple: if your board has a 100MHz oscillator, then
you know it runs at 100MHz.  Having no more information, that’s often easy
enough to work with on its own.  Is it really at 100MHz?  Exactly?  Of course
not, but without any more information then that’s all you have to work with.
At least within the universe of only a single clock, everything is consistent
alone.</p>

<p>Once you have two clocks in your system, they will then disagree with
each other and you will never be certain which of the two is correct.</p>

<p>Still, you will want to know if your Ethernet clock is truly at 125MHz, the
video clock at 148.5MHz, or the audio clock at 49.152MHz.  Indeed, just
knowing these clocks are present might well be half the battle.</p>

<p>For now, let’s just pick a 100MHz clock as an arbitrary reference, and then
see if we can measure the rates of these other clocks with respect to that
reference.  Of course, any estimate will only be as good as the reference
clock.</p>

<h2 id="three-methods-of-frequency-measurement">Three methods of frequency measurement</h2>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 2. Three methods of frequency estimation</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/clkcounter/methods.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In general, there are three methods of frequency estimation.  You can count
transitions, <a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">track the clock phase and frequency using a
PLL</a>,
or use <a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">an FFT</a>.  Let’s quickly
look at each in turn, starting with the
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>-based frequency measurement</p>

    <p>The grand-daddy of all frequency measurement methods is clearly the
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>.  It’s closely related to
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation">maximum likelihood
method</a> of
frequency estimation.  It can also be robust against harmonics.  Here’s how
you’d do it:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Enter in a set of samples.  These can come from an incoming clock, or even
an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">Analog to Digital Converter
(ADC)</a>.  The
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a> isn’t particular.</li>
      <li>Calculate the
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a> of the set</li>
      <li>Calculate the absolute value (squared) across the set</li>
      <li>Pick the value with the maximum magnitude–perhaps restricting your
search to a known window where the frequency of interest will take place.
Such restrictions can greatly increase your ability to estimate when
in the presence of a lot of noise.  This is something I discussed in <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a423141.pdf">my
Ph.D. dissertation</a>.</li>
      <li>The “bin” of number of that maximum magnitude location, times your
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>’s incoming sample rate,
is now your estimate of the frequency of interest.  This will get you to
within about one 
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a> bin’s worth of precision.</li>
      <li>Want to do better?  You can interpolate between
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>
bins near that maximum to find where the maximum exists between bins.
Be aware when doing this, however, that the absolute value operation will
distort your result.  You may therefore need to oversample by 16x or so
before picking the sample you want to interpolate from.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your first problem with implementing this algorithm on an FPGA, however, will
be the complexity of the <a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>.
It’s not trivial.  An <a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>
requires at least 3 multiplies per stage, and <em>lots</em> of block RAM to store
in-process results along the way.  Whether or not this is really a problem
is really a question of how good you want your frequency estimate to be.
Remember, it’ll never be better than your knowledge of your reference
clock speed, so there’s a limit on how hard you need to work.</p>

    <p>Your second problem will be the division used by the interpolator.  It’s
doable, but not trivial.</p>

    <p>What makes <a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>-based methods
so valuable is their resistance to interference.  If you have multiple
frequencies coming into a design, and you want to measure only one of them
or perhaps each one of them, the
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a> should be able to get you
much closer than any other approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Breaking the FFT (Guru discussion)</p>

    <p>Okay, I know I said there were three types of frequency estimation, but I
got in an argument with a coworker a while ago and want to have a chance at
saying I got things right one more time …</p>

    <p>Let’s say you have a set of samples from x[0] to X[N-1].  This coworker
noticed that if you took two
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>s
of this data set, one from x[0] to x[N-2] that we’ll call Y0[f] and the
other from x[1] to x[N-1] that we’ll call Y1[f], then you can conjugate
multiply the two together.  The phase difference between the two
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>s,
at the bin of interest, is then proportional to the frequency of interest.
Since that phase estimate is a real number, rather than a quantized
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>
bin, this coworker argued that the resulting frequency estimates were
that much better.</p>

    <p>So, I ran some tests.  The full
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>
method outperformed this pairwise phase difference method by several dB’s.</p>

    <p>If you go farther and expand out summation of an
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a> result’s magnitude
squared, you’ll discover this pairwise method is a subset of the original
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>
based magnitude method that you can get to by throwing terms away.
Of course it only makes sense that you’d do better if you didn’t throw
any terms away in the first place.</p>

    <p>Incidentally, I was never able to convince this coworker.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using a <a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">PLL</a></p>

    <p>By this, I mean using a <a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">logic PLL, such as the one we’ve already discussed
on this blog</a>.
<a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">PLL</a>s have the advantage
over an
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>
in that they are much simpler to build.  Like the
<a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>,
they also have some amount of out-of-band noise immunity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3. Transition counting</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/clkcounter/bitsync.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Unlike an <a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a>, a
  <a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">PLL</a> can only capture
  one frequency at a time.  Further, an
  <a href="/dsp/2018/10/02/fft.html">FFT</a> will find a tone in a
  deterministic amount of time, whereas it’s hard to predict how much data is
  required before being able to get a
  <a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">PLL</a> to lock.  Worse, it
  is quite possible for a
  <a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">PLL</a> to lock to a wrong
  frequency–even something way out of bounds if it is strong enough.  Still,
  with some conditioning circuitry, a
  <a href="/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html">PLL</a>
  should be able to handle most conditions just fine.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Counting transitions</p>

    <p>Counting clock transitions is easy.  So easy, in fact, that we’ll take
another look at it in depth in the next section.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="counting-transitions">Counting Transitions</h2>

<p>Calculating a clock frequency by counting transitions is really easy.  I mean,
<em>really</em> easy.  There’s two parts to it.  The first part tells us
when to start and stop counting, and the second just counts transitions.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2017/06/02/generating-timing.html">We’ve looked at that first part
before</a>.  In
general, there are two ways to generate a once per second signal, something
I call a one-part-per-second (PPS) signal after my background with using GPS.
Your two options are to either use an integer or a fractional divider.</p>

<p>Here’s what the integer divider method would look like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">one_second_countdown</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">begin</span>
	<span class="n">o_pps</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="n">one_second_countdown</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">CLOCK_RATE_HZ</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">begin</span>
	<span class="n">o_pps</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="n">one_second_countdown</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">one_second_countdown</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It basically consists of a counter just counting down from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CLOCK_RATE_HZ</code>
to one (not zero), and restarting.  When the clock would otherwise be zero,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_pps</code> gets set to indicate we’re going around again.</p>

<p>The fractional clock divider approach looks completely different, but
fundamentally does the exact same thing.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">parameter</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">CLOCK_STEP</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mh">32'h0</span> <span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">CLOCK_RATE_HZ</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">o_pps</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fraction_of_second</span> <span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">fraction_of_second</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">CLOCK_STEP</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Watch out for overflow in your implementation!  My favorite way to express
this is as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(1&lt;&lt;32) / CLOCK_RATE_HZ</code>, but this can cause overflow within any
tool that’s not ready for a 33-bit number.</p>

<p>Whichever method you use, you now have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_pps</code> signal you can use to
indicate when your clock counter should start and stop counting.</p>

<p>That leads us to the next step, actually counting.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_pps</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">transition</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">transition</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">initial</span>	<span class="n">o_result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_pps</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">o_result</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There’s two things to note carefully here.  The first is that
I placed the result, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o_result</code>, in its own register.
This will keep you from ever reading an invalid result–once the clock counter
has it’s first result.  The second key is that you need to be able to count
on every clock tick.  That includes the clock tick when you reset the counter,
otherwise you’ll risk dropping a count.</p>

<p>But where does the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transition</code> flag above come from?  Well, ideally, we’d
want this to be true to any time the clock we are counting rises so we
can count that rise.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">last_test_clock</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">test_clock</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">// This could also be done combinatorially, depending upon the timing</span>
<span class="c1">// requirements within your design</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">transition</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_clock</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">last_test_clock</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Okay, that’s great if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_clock</code> is already synchronous with your system
clock, but in the general case of clock counting it’s not likely to be.
That means we’re going to need to go through a <a href="/blog/2017/10/20/cdc.html">2FF clock domain
crossing</a>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="kt">reg</span>	<span class="n">test_clock_cdc</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">test_clock</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">test_clock_cdc</span> <span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">test_clock_cdc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">raw_test_clock</span> <span class="o">}</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Only, what happens if the test clock is faster than half your system clock
rate?  That is, what happens if you don’t get a high sample followed by a
low sample, followed by a high sample since the test clock comes in too
fast?  This method would miss transitions.</p>

<p>This was why, when building my own design, I first dropped the clock speed
of the test clock before counting it, as in:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="kt">reg</span>	<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">LGNAVGS</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>	<span class="n">avgs</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_test_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">avgs</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">avgs</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">test_clock</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">test_clock_cdc</span> <span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">test_clock_cdc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">avgs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">LGNAVGS</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">}</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Much to my surprise, this technique worked for clocks even as fast as 400MHz+!
Perhaps this isn’t as momentous as you might think.  If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LGNAVGS=4</code>, then
this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avgs</code> logic takes no more than 4 LUTs and 4 FF’s.  It’s not a lot of
logic.  For reference, though, I tend to get surprised when things work above
100MHz, and more surprised when they work above 200MHz–but that’s just an
indication of the problem space I tend to work within.</p>

<p>Shall we take a look at the whole design from top to bottom?</p>

<h2 id="the-clock-counting-design">The Clock Counting Design</h2>

<p>The design below is quite generic for just about any clock speed.  Just
a couple notes, though, before starting.</p>

<p>First, this design uses a PPS signal generated by my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/rtcclock/blob/master/rtl/rtclight.v">real-time clock
core</a>.
This PPS signal is typically <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/rtcclock/blob/c6df3c8a1955d066c5addbb6ddb78290e648f2f1/rtl/rtclight.v#L116-L133">generated internally from a 48-bit fractional
counter</a>.
Even better, I have a version of that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/rtcclock/blob/master/rtl/rtcgps.v">real-time clock
core</a> that
integrates nicely with an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/gpsclock.v">external PLL-based tracking
loop</a> applied to
the PPS signal from a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-gps-gps-receiver/">GPS
receiver</a>,
so let’s just assume it’s generated externally.</p>

<p>Second, I set the number of bits in the counter to 32, simply because that’s
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">the common bus width that I normally
use</a>.</p>

<p>Third, I’ve named the two clocks, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_sys_clk</code> for the system clock and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_tst_clk</code> for the clock under test.  Both signals are assumed to be
true <em>clocks</em>, and so available on the clock routing network of the FPGA.</p>

<p>That said, let’s dig in.</p>

<p>The first step is to divide the incoming clock frequency down to something
we can sample.  I’ve chosen to divide by 16 (LGNAVGS=4), but this decision
should really be determined by the needs you have within your design.  Still,
16 has been plenty for my own uses.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_tst_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">avgs</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">avgs</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This incoming clock divider is the <em>only</em> part of this design where I
transition on the test clock.  (Remember <a href="/blog/2017/08/21/rules-for-newbies.html">my rule about using only one clock
domain if possible</a>?)</p>

<p>The next step is to take the top bit of that divisor and run it
through a <a href="/blog/2017/10/20/cdc.html">two clock synchronizer</a>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_sys_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">tst_clock_cdc</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">tst_clock_cdc</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">avgs</span><span class="p">[(</span><span class="n">LGNAVGS</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)]</span> <span class="o">}</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>From here, I can check for positive edges.  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tst_posedge</code> will be true
one clock after a positive edge.  Of course, the one clock delay doesn’t
matter here, so there’s no real cost in delaying by a clock.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_sys_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">tst_posedge</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tst_clock_cdc</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mb">2'b01</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s all the preliminary work.  Now, we can finally do some clock counting.</p>

<p>Just like you saw above, we’ll count upwards on every clock cycle.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_sys_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_sys_pps</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tst_posedge</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tst_posedge</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mb">1'b1</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The last step is to report the results back on one of our ports.  We’ll make
one change to this logic here.  Because we divided the clock initially, we’ll
multiply our result by the amount we divided the clock by–just so that we
have a value that’s at least close to the right answer.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_sys_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_sys_pps</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">r_sys_counts</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">;</span>

	<span class="k">assign</span>	<span class="n">o_sys_counts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">r_sys_counts</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">LGNAVGS</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="mb">1'b0</span><span class="o">}}</span> <span class="o">}</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">endmodule</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s all there is to it.  The operation is fairly commonplace, but still
quite simple.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Feel free to create a simple peripheral containing this core, either
<a href="/blog/2020/03/08/easyaxil.html">AXI-lite</a> or
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/29/simple-wishbone.html">Wishbone</a>.  Indeed,
I’m currently <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/vgasim/blob/e5c020ea2b1d2d444612743defcaab5bd8a98d7e/rtl/axicamera.v#L449-L451">doing exactly that in this video ingestion logic that I’m
currently working on</a>.
You might also connect it to a <a href="/tutorial/">serial port controller via a
FSM such as I presented in the tutorial</a>.  I
think you’ll be pleased with the result.</p>

<p>One of the neat things of this approach is that it can also detect the
absence of a clock.  If there are no clock pulses, the counts per second will
be zero.  (You will still need your system clock.)  I’ve found this to be a
great advantage when working with video, since it will let you know if the
video signal is even present as a first step towards debugging the rest of the
design.</p>
