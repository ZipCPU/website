  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Symbiotic EDA has a fascinating product called <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY: Mutation coverage with
Yosys</a>.  The idea behind
<a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a> is that it will subtly change
(mutate) your design to then see if your test bench can catch the changes.
The goal is to measure, not how good your design is, but rather how complete
your test bench is.</p>

<p>I’ve now tried <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a>
on a couple of my designs.  I’ve tried it on the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>,
and I’ve tried it on the <a href="/blog/2020/03/08/easyaxil.html">Easy AXI-lite slave we built together on the
blog</a>.
In both cases, it worked as advertised, yet left me a little bit unsettled
by what my test benches weren’t checking for.</p>

<p>In the case of the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>, I already
knew that my test bench was flawed: I’d long since abandoned it for serious
testing <a href="/blog/2018/04/02/formal-cpu-bugs.html">in favor of formal
methods</a>.  Sure enough,
<a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a> found holes in my
test bench–primarily in the fact that just running a program on the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
from simulation never checked the debugging interface.
Even the test bench that did check the debugging interface never checked that
registers within the CPU could be read or written to via the same debugging
interface.</p>

<p>Shame on me.  That should’ve been a part of my test bench.</p>

<p>The <a href="/blog/2020/03/08/easyaxil.html">Easy AXI-lite slave made for another valuable
test</a>.  In this case, I
had built a very quick <a href="/blog/2020/04/08/axitb.html">Verilator-based simulation test
bench</a> for it to test it
against.  <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a> gave this test bench a
coverage number of only 60% or so, meaning that my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/mcy/easyaxil/easyaxil_tb.cpp">Verilator based test
bench</a>
could only find 60% of the mutations.</p>

<p>What did I miss?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>My simulation never checked whether or not the byte enables were handled
properly.  This follows from the fact that my test bench only ever checked
reading from and writing to entire words.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simulation never checked whether or not the design could handle
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">back-pressure</a> on the
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI bus</a>.</p>

    <p>This is a sad reality of simulations.  Why check for proper
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">back-pressure</a> handling
if you know, whenever you issue a request, that you’ll want to get a response
from that request?</p>

    <p>I find roughly 1-2 help requests per week on <a href="https://forums.xilinx.com">Xilinx’s
forums</a> are due to individuals using one of
<a href="/formal/2019/09/06/axi-story.html">Xilinx’s broken AXI demonstration
cores</a>.
As you may recall, these cores were primarily broken because they didn’t
properly handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">back-pressure</a>.
Because simulations never checked for this, and <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/axi-vip.html">their AXI
VIP</a> never
generated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">back-pressure</a>,
users are often left with a false sense of security that their design works
when the opposite is the case.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When I reconfigured <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a> to check the
<em>formal</em> proof of my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/easyaxil.v">Easy AXI-lite design
(EASYAXIL)</a>,
coverage then went up to 79%.  Wait, only 79%?  Isn’t
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal verification</a>
supposed to be comprehensive?  Isn’t it supposed to be exhaustive?  What
happened?</p>

<p>What happened was that I had set up my formal proof to check for bus protocol
violations.  I never checked whether or not the values returned by the bus were
the right ones.  In other words, of the <a href="/formal/2020/06/12/four-keys.html">four checks required for any formal
sign off</a>, I had only
checked three.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve had many opportunities to build simple bus slaves, and this
lesson has left me knowing that my simulations and formal proofs were often
incomplete.  This has left me feeling exposed and vulnerable, and so today
I’d like to correct that lack.  Let’s take a look, therefore, at a simple
property set we can add to our design to make certain that any registers within
it behave as desired.</p>

<p>First, however, lets back up and look at what I was able to learn from
<a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a>.</p>

<h2 id="mcy-results">MCY Results</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a> requires a bit of setup to get
it up and running.  Sadly, that setup is often different from one simulator
to the next.  It’s complicated enough that I’m not going to go into all the
details here.  If you wan to see how I did it, feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/tree/master/bench/mcy/easyaxil">my setup
here</a>.</p>

<p>One of my frustrations with this setup is that I was unable to use my design
as it was written.  Normally, I build a design and write formal properties into
the design at the bottom of the file.  Why?  Because passing induction
requires making assertions about the state of the design across register states.
This leads to a white box testing approach, rather than the more traditional
black box testing approach.  Keeping the properties together with the design
seems to facilitate that for me.</p>

<p>The problem with leaving properties at the bottom of the design is that the
mutation engine might mutate the properties, and not just the logic.  To make
this work, the two must be separated.  This forced me to create a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/mcy/easyaxil/easyprops.sv">separate
property file to encapsulate the properties required to verify my
design</a>,
and <a href="http://www.asic-world.com/systemverilog/assertions22.html">then to <em>bind</em> it to the
design</a>.
Access to the SVA <em>bind</em> capability currently requires the commercial version
of SymbiYosys.</p>

<p>Still, once set up, I could initialize
<a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a> and apply it to my design.
Here, for example, are the results from applying my Verilator-based
simulation test alone.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">% mcy init

Coverage: 64.04%</code></pre></figure>

<p>This tells us that, without formal verification, of the 1000 mutations
that were applied to this design, 634 were were caught by the simulation check.
That’s a good thing, though I would like this number to be higher. However, it
might be that a change may have been made to the design that doesn’t affect
any of its outputs.  In order to check for this possibility, I applied an
equivalence check to the two designs.  If this check finds the mutated design
equivalent to the non-mutated design, after searching through (in this case)
15 time steps then the difference might be irrelevant–so we’ll call it
“NOCHANGE”.  Of all of the mutations, there were only 21 of 1000
times where the equivalence check couldn’t find any difference in performance
as a result of the mutation.  Of those 21 times, the simulation caught the
mutation 7 of those times–showing that our equivalence check couldn’t quite
catch all the changes.</p>

<p>In general, though, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/mcy/easyaxil/easyaxil_tb.cpp">my simulation test
bench</a>
only caught 64% of all of the mutations.  That’s not a great number.
That means 36% of the time a bug might get past my simulation.</p>

<p>Let’s see if we can improve upon this number by adding formal verification
into the mix.  Here you can see the end of the output below.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Database contains 2359 cached results.

Tagged 12 mutations as "NOCHANGE".
Tagged 204 mutations as "UNCOVERED".
Found 7 mutations exposing a formal equivalence gap!
Coverage: 79.20%</code></pre></figure>

<p>In this case, we applied our formal check to only those mutations that
didn’t pass the simulation test.  Here we find that 641 mutations of the total
1000 were caught by simulation, and of those 359 tests that were missed, another
143 were caught by formal verification <a href="/blog/2020/03/08/easyaxil.html">using the properties we developed
before</a>.</p>

<p>The problem is that this number should be much higher.  Formal methods
<em>should’ve</em> caught everything.  They didn’t, however, because we never checked
the return data from the design (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXI_RDATA</code>)–we only checked that there
was an output value, not that it was the right one.</p>

<p>For that, we’re going to add register checking to our test.  This time, our
coverage goes up to 99.9%.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Database contains 2386 cached results.
Database contains 981 cached "FAIL" results for "test_eq".

Coverage: 99.90%</code></pre></figure>

<p>That means that 99.9% of all mutations were (now) properly found by either
our simulation check, or the updated formal properties for
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/easyaxil.v">this core</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 1. Verification Coverage</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/regcheck/rcheck-pie.png" alt="" width="357" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Let’s plot out these numbers in Fig. 1, and then go back them to see if we
can get a feel for what’s going on.  First, of the 1000 mutation checks, 614
of them, or 61.4%, were caught by simulation alone.
(This is really backwards, as my first step to verifying a core is <a href="/blog/2020/04/01/design-flow.html">typically a
formal verification check</a>,
not simulation check, but running simulation first was how I was shown to
set up <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a>.)
Of the 386 times where simulation didn’t find the mutation, a
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">formal property check</a>
was applied to the design.  In
373 of those cases, the formal property check found the mutation leaving
13 cases were neither formal nor simulation were able to find the mutation.
Twelve of those cases involved a design that didn’t fundamentally change,
whereas the last one was a protocol valid design that was just … different
from the original.  The difference?  The mutated design took an extra clock
to return the result.  Since it was valid, from a protocol standpoint, it
passed the formal check.  Since the mutated design wasn’t externally equivalent
to the original, <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a> flagged this as
an “UNCOVERED” mutation above.</p>

<p>That explains the blue, “Simulation only”, region and the green “No change”
region in Fig. 1 above.  However, the register checking and AXI property
regions–while adding up to 373, are only approximately supported by the data
above.  Sadly, I violated several principles of data handling to plot the
differences between these two sets, so
let me at least explain what I did: The second test showed that
641/1000 mutations were found via simulation, and an additional 143/1000 were
found via simulation alone.  If we accept that a rough 143 mutations chosen
in the third test therefore would’ve been found using formal methods with
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI properties</a>
alone–you might come up
with 143/1000 or 14.3% additional coverage via using formal properties.
Sadly, this isn’t truly an apples to apples comparison, since the second and
third runs of <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/mcy">MCY</a> were based upon two
separate sets of mutations and I’m now comparing statistics drawn from one
sample set to those of another.  Therefore, let me only say that these
percentages are somewhat approximate–since they will change from run to
run as the mutation engine randomly picks different design mutations.</p>

<p>So for the rest of this article, I’d like to look at what it took to get this
design from a formal proof that only verified 79% of its functionality
(run #2) to one that gets to the 99.9% shown in Fig. 1.  The difference was a
<a href="/formal/2020/06/12/four-keys.html">contract check</a>
that I used to verify the various internal register values.</p>

<h2 id="register-checking">Register Checking</h2>

<p>Let me start by addressing the question of “what is a register”, followed
by my approach to register checking.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 2. An AXI-Lite GPIO peripheral, with a register for output control</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/regcheck/axil-gpio-reg.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Many designs have multiple registers within them that can be controlled from an
external bus by writing to or reading from some address in the design’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_map">memory
map</a>.  A classic example would be a
<a href="/zipcpu/2019/02/09/cpu-blinky.html">GPIO device</a>, such
as the one shown in Fig. 2.  Such a device might simply control the outgoing
voltage on a series of output wires.  If you set a particular bit in a <a href="/zipcpu/2019/02/09/cpu-blinky.html">GPIO
register</a>
to a ‘1’, the wire controlled by that register might emit a positive voltage
on the external output pin, whereas if the bit were set to ‘0’ the wire is
held at ground.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 3. An AXI DMA has several control registers</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/regcheck/axidma.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Register uses go well beyond simple
<a href="/zipcpu/2019/02/09/cpu-blinky.html">GPIO peripherals</a>.
Indeed, most if not all of the peripherals and controllers I’ve built have
some form of register control to them.  In the case of <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip">my DMA
engines</a>, shown in Fig. 3, the transfer
length, source and destination addresses are all configured via a
bus-accessible register.  For <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">my UART</a>,
the baud rate can be configured via the bus.  For <a href="/zipcpu/2018/04/17/ziptimer.html">the countdown
timer</a>?  The time duration.
<a href="/zipcpu/2019/04/02/icontrol.html">The interrupt controller</a>?
Which interrupts are enabled and which are cleared.  The <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">QSPI flash
controller</a>?  Which mode
the controller is currently operating within.  How about the <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">Wishbone
scope</a>?
The delay from trigger to the end of the capture.  The list goes on.  Indeed,
it might seem that every RTL controller I’ve built has some amount of registers
within it.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 4. Xilinx's IPIF</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/regcheck/ipif.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Today, we’re going to focus on modifying the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/easyaxil.v">EASYAXIL
design</a> to add
formal register checking to the formal properties checking this design.  This
way, if any future modification breaks the design later on, the properties will
be able to quickly catch the change.</p>

<p>Here’s how we’ll do it: we’ll create a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_register.v">formal register checking module</a>,
and then we’ll attach <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_register.v">this module</a>
to each of the four registers internal to this design to make certain that
those registers can each be both read from and written to.</p>

<p>Let’s look through how we might build <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_register.v">such a
module</a>.</p>

<p>If we want to verify that our register gets written to or read from on
any bus access to a given address, then the first step will be to configure
our check for the right address.  That means we’ll need to configure this
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_register.v">formal register property set</a>
with an address, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ADDR</code>, that is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AW</code> bits wide,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">module</span>	<span class="n">faxil_register</span> <span class="p">#(</span>
		<span class="k">parameter</span>		<span class="n">AW</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span>
		<span class="k">parameter</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">AW</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>	<span class="n">ADDR</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and for a bus of some data width, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DW</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">parameter</span>		<span class="n">DW</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">,</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Not all registers can be fully written to.  For example, if you write to the
configuration register in my <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">QSPI
controller</a>,
then the bottom eight bits might get sent out the QSPI port, while bits <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[11:8]</code>
can be read and written like a (normal) register.
The <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">Wishbone
scope</a>
is similar: the bottom 20 bits control the <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">holdoff from the
trigger</a>, whereas the top
4 bits are status bits returned by the design.  To
know which bits should be checked for a generic read/write capability, we’ll
need a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASK</code> parameter.  Under this scheme, for every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASK[BIT]</code> that is
set, the bit numbered <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BIT</code> will be checked to see if it can be read and
written from the bus.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">parameter</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">DW</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>	<span class="n">MASK</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>.</p>

<p>As a final parameter, some designs require asynchronous resets.  While I
don’t normally use them, some contexts require them.  Therefore we’ll make an
option for asynchronous reset handling, and come back to this again later.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">		<span class="k">parameter</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>		<span class="n">OPT_ASYNC_RESET</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mb">1'b0</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>.</p>

<p>That’s the first step, knowing how to configure the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_register.v">property
checker</a>
for our register.</p>

<p>The next step will be to keep a local copy of the register within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_register.v">formal register property set</a>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="kt">reg</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">DW</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>	<span class="n">f_reg</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, any time the register we are checking is written to, we’ll keep track of
it’s value in our local copy, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_reg</code>.  To do this, I’ve slightly simplified the
interface slightly from the AXI-lite protocol.  Specifically, I’ve created an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXIL_AWW</code> port with a (rough) equivalence to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXIL_AWVALID &amp;&amp; S_AXIL_AWREADY</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXIL_WVALID &amp;&amp; S_AXIL_WREADY</code>–since
this is our rule for writing to the register in the first place.  If
therefore <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXIL_AWW</code> is true and the requested address matches the
address of our register, then we’ll update the various bytes in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_reg</code>
as requested by the bus.</p>

<p>If we want any hope of passing
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>, then
we’ll want to check this register when nothing is happening.  To make that
happen, let’s have the design pass what it thinks the value of the register
is in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_register</code> input port.  We can then check this value against <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_reg</code>
on all clock cycles.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">S_AXI_ACLK</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">S_AXI_ARESETN</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="p">$</span><span class="nb">past</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">S_AXI_ARESETN</span><span class="p">))</span>

<p>This is a rather convoluted way of saying that all of the bits of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASK</code>
should match <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f_reg</code>, and that we can ignore any other bits.  Just to convince
ourselves that this works, if any two bits are identical then their exclusive
OR will be zero.  Anything that’s not zero represents a difference between
these two values.  When we then AND the result with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASK</code>, we check for
only those bit-differences that we actually care about.</p>

<p>In an attempt to be complete, I also added return strobe checking to this
register coding check.  In short sum, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BVALID</code> should be set following any
write, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RVALID</code> should be set following any read request.</p>

<p>The actual check is complicated by the fact that we’re not really checking for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!BVALID</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!RVALID</code>.  Sure, we’ve got a reset check–but that’s really
just to make sure the reset doesn’t interfere with the check that follows.
The reality is that we can’t do a complete check of either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BVALID</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RVALID</code>
here since we don’t know if or when some other register will be accessed.  It
might be that we are checking the register located at
address <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8</code> here, but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BVALID</code> gets set due to a write to register found at
address <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4</code>.  This only works because we’ve already done a <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">full protocol
check</a>–we’re just
checking register values now.</p>

<p>Our last register check will be on the return value.  If there’s ever a
request to read from our register, denoted here by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXIL_AR</code> which is
equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXIL_ARVALID &amp;&amp; S_AXIL_ARREADY</code> (or it’s equivalent coming
from the <a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skidbuffer</a>),
then we’ll check the result against the register that’s supposed to be returned.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">S_AXI_ACLK</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Or, at least, that’s the basics of what we want to do: 1) maintain a copy
of the register, 2) adjust that copy on any write, 3) check our copy against
the copy within the design, and 4) verify that any read requests return
that value.</p>

<p>There’s one sticking point that haven’t yet addressed: how shall this register
be initialized?  My current approach has been to copy to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_register</code>
value following any reset.</p>

<p>In hindsight, a better solution might be to create a default parameter, and
then <em>verify</em> that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_register</code> actually has the right value–rather than
just trusting its reset value.  For this reason, I might come back and adjust
this logic to make that happen at a later time.  For now, let’s try it out and
see how it works.</p>

<h2 id="updating-the-easy-axi-lite-demonstration-core">Updating the Easy AXI-lite demonstration core</h2>

<p>The last step is to incorporate this register check into the formal property
section of our <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/easyaxil.v">EASYAXIL
core</a>.  This is
the easy step–we just instantiate it like any other module–once per each of

<p>Since the other four are (nearly) identical, I’ll skip repeating myself here
for brevity.</p>

<p>Before going on, let me remind you of the definitions of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">axil_write_ready</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">axil_read_ready</code> signals.  These are two signals found within the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/easyaxil.v">EASYAXIL core</a>.
They’re used as the signal, internal to the design, that writes (or reads)
are to happen on a given clock cycle.  Their actual definition depends upon
whether or not the design is using
<a href="/blog/2019/05/22/skidbuffer.html">skidbuffers</a> or not.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that it’s easy to add this check into our design, and as
a result we now go from 79% to 99% verification coverage.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, let me ask, would I ever use this in practice?</p>

<p>Well, when I first saw the mutation coverage gap in this design, I somewhat
scoffed at it.  Of course my design “worked”.  I could look it over and be
certain it worked.  Why would I need to add in more properties?</p>

<p>Since that time, I’ve started building simulation-based register connectivity
checks when running the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> with
any new design.  These checks are run from software (i.e. C/C++), to make
certain that all registers might be reachable and configurable in simulation.
This is actually a really good test to run, since I am aware of at least one
ASIC project where the designer forgot to connect the byte-enable lines between
the CPU and the bus and this would catch that bug.  The check also catches
mis-matched address bugs, etc.  It’s a really good test to run, and so I’m
starting to add it to my bring up code for any new design.</p>

<p>Then I started building a register set for an ASIC project I’m working on.
That design doesn’t (yet) have a <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
to run software tests from.  (That’s why I’m building an AXI interface for the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>–but that’s another topic.)
Unlike the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/easyaxil.v">EASYAXIL
design</a>, this ASIC
design was much more complicated.  Some register bits needed setting, others
had other controls, and … well, it was just complicated enough that I
needed a little more assurance I was doing it right–hence the reason
for the little module above.  Did I find bugs in my early drafts?  You bet!
Have I found bugs since when updating the design?  Yes.  Indeed, more than
one update to that design introduced bugs that were then found and fixed by
this register checking approach.</p>

<p>Just as an example, without this check I might’ve allowed the following logic
through:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">S_AXI_ACLK</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">negedge</span> <span class="n">S_AXI_ARESETN</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These two bugs are representative of the sorts of bugs I found using these
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_register.v">register value properties</a>.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that, while this might seem like a simple test, it’s an
important one in order to complete the proof of a slave register set.</p>
