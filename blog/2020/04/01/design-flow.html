    <p>Someone recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/fmxe9t/which_dev_board_should_i_use_for_riscv_and/">asked me on reddit, “Do you have a blog post or something
like that which explains the high-level view of your toolchain?”</a></p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1. Favorite Tools</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/design-flow/chosen-tools.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>
<p>The quick answer is that my preferred tools are shown in Fig. 1 on the right.
Each of these tools has its purpose.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make">GNU make</a> is fundamentally a software
build management tool.  It tries to build components by only rebuilding
those pieces that have changed.  It’s generic enough that it can be tuned
for generating hardware build products as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a> is the
tool I use to compose a design built from multiple bus components.  I’ve
so far managed to (mostly) avoid vendor tools when doing this.  As an
example, I don’t (normally) use the Vivado IP integrator at all.</p>

    <p>I say “mostly”, because I’m currently working with my first Zynq Ultrascale+
board and I’m still using the IP integrator for that design.  I don’t expect
to use it for long.  Indeed, I’m not expecting to use it longer than it’s
required to transition to an
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
based design, like I did with the <a href="/blog/2018/02/09/first-cyclonev.html">Intel Platform Designer on my Cyclone-V
design</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en">SymbiYosys</a>, used for formally
verifying any cores I work with.  I’ve also used the
<a href="https://www.symbioticeda.com/seda-suite">Symbiotic EDA Suite</a>
quite successfully for full SV designs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a> is
my tool of choice for design
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>.
I find it ideal for when I wish to integrate component emulation, such as
a multi-GigaBytes <a href="/blog/2019/11/14/sdspi.html">SD card</a> or
a <a href="/blog/2018/11/29/llvga.html">VGA display</a>,
with an integrated design test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://iverilog.icarus.com">iverilog</a> is a nice open source Verilog
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>
tool.  While I don’t normally use the simulation subset of
Verilog, when I do I’ve used <a href="http://iverilog.icarus.com">iverilog</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys">Yosys</a> is an open source synthesis tool
that has replaced several vendor synthesis tools.  I’ve now used it
successfully on my
<a href="/zipcpu/2019/03/12/arrowzip.html">ArrowZip</a> project, and
all of <a href="/projects.html">my ECP5 and iCE40 projects</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr">NextPNR</a> is an open source place and
route tool that has also replaced several vendor place and route tools in
my design implementation flow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vendor tools typically include Vivado or Quartus.</p>

    <p>My recent attempts to work with Vitis have resulted in either the tool
crashing (when following the vendor tutorial of all things!) or some other
unexpected behaviors.  Unfortunately, it seems like <a href="https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Vitis-SDAccel-and-SDSoC/Updating-BSP-in-Vitis/td-p/1072961">the product isn’t
really ready for market</a>
despite being placed on the market.  Forum support for bugs is also
spotty at best.</p>

    <p>I’m also not sure if I will use Quartus again.  My last attempt to
install Quartus failed due to a version incompatibility with KDE that had
been years in the making.  I haven’t gone back to see if they’d fixed it
yet, but the bug report that I found describing my problem was months old
when I found it and not only was it still unfixed, but Intel hadn’t announced
any plans to fix it at that time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">GTKWave</a> is my favorite waveform viewing
tool.  It’s simple and easy to use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.wavedrom.com/editor.html">Wavedrom</a> is my go-to program for
drawing waveforms for sharing in either blog posts or in tweets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-timing">Tikz-timing</a> is my favorite program for
generating waveforms when writing formal LaTeX documents.  While I would
prefer using <a href="https://www.wavedrom.com/editor.html">Wavedrom</a> to generate
SVG files for inclusion in LaTeX (they look nicer), I like using
underscores in variable names and my favorite SVG to eps converter,
<a href="https://inkscape.org/">inkscape</a>, leaves behind LaTeX files that can’t
handle underscores very well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a> for all software compiling, to include compiling
any programs for the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.
This also includes <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils">binutils</a> under
the hood.  If I have to build a program for MicroBlaze, NiOS II, or even ARM,
my preference would be to do so using <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 2. Never trust the tool with your sources</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/design-flow/msword-story.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> is currently my preferred choice for managing
source control.  I’ve used <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion (SVN)</a>
and <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> as well, but I use
<a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> often enough that I don’t (normally) have to
check the manual for usage information.  Put simply, when used well
<a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> provides the user the ability to “undo” any
massive design changes they may have made since the last commit.</p>

    <p>This also means that I dislike editors or other IDE’s that store design
information in a file I cannot review line-by-line in order to unroll any
changes that the tool might make to my design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/sw/host/zipload.cpp">zipload</a>
isn’t really a project of its own right.  Instead, it’s a program that I
rebuild into each new project I make.  As mentioned above, I use it to
load software into block RAM, flash or SDRAM as desired.  Many versions will
also load FPGA configurations into flash as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus">dbgbus</a> is a fundamental piece of any
design I’ve ever built.  It gives me an external debugging port into the
design in the form of a (typically) UART to Wishbone bridge.  I currently
have two debugging buses I work with: the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/tree/hexbus">hexbus</a>–a simple bus we
build here on this blog, and a more complicated
<a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">wbubus</a> offering
compression and more buffering capabilities.  Recent upgrades to each bus
have provided them with UART to AXI4 bus mastering capabilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">wbscope</a>
is the tool I use for any <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">hardware
debugging</a> I find
that I need to do.</p>

    <p>It was fun, some time back, to be able to present to Xilinx support staff
a 4-second trace showing AXI interactions between my own design and the
MIG-based memory core I was working with.  Their MIG core was producing
xVALID signals I wasn’t expecting, and their best guess was that I had
requested something prior to the trace window.  The only way to prove I
hadn’t was to get a full 4 second trace from the initial state to the bug. 
How did I do it?  There’s a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/wbscopc.v">version of the wbscope that compresses its
observations</a>.
This allowed be to record long periods of idle time before the test of
interest, and so I could tell Xilinx that their MIG core was actually
producing xVALID signals that my design hadn’t requested.  (The problem
turned out to be a mis-identified DDR chip in the end, not the MIG core
at all–but that’s another story for another day.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The longer answer is that my design flow really depends upon what I’m doing.
Am I 1) building a component, 2) integrating many components together into
a design, 3) bringing up a new hardware interface, or 4) <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">iterating on an
existing design to narrow down the location of a
bug</a>.</p>

<h2 id="component-design">Component Design</h2>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 3. Component Design Flow</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/design-flow/component.svg" alt="" width="120" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Design components are special, primarily because they tend to be of a small
enough complexity that they can be fully verified using formal tools.
“Component” in this case, usually refers to a piece of a design having a bus
interface of some type.  Example “components” include the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>,
<a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">bus crossbars</a>,
<a href="/blog/2020/03/23/wbm2xbar.html">bus masters and bridges</a>,
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash controllers</a>,
<a href="/dsp/2020/03/17/cheap-spectra.html">spectrum analyzers</a>
and more.</p>

<p>After dealing with several painful errors earlier in my FPGA journey, I don’t
connect anything to the bus that doesn’t pass a <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">formal verification check of
the bus interface</a>.  Why
not?  Well, for a couple
reasons.  First, its notoriously difficult to debug a larger design containing
a broken bus within it.  It’s also much easier to debug a bus components using
formal methods than it is via
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>.
Second, as I mentioned above, I use a <a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">bus based
scope</a>
for debugging hardware interactions.  If the bus ever breaks, I can’t use my
scope and, well, that slows me down.  (I’ll hang my head in dismay and close
up shop for a day to cry about it.  Eventually, I come back after some serious
prayer time.) Third, you can often recover pieces of a broken design and
still use it–as long as everything on the bus works.</p>

<p>So, rule #1 is that every bus component <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">must have its bus interactions
formally verified</a>.
I allow no exceptions–primarily because I get burned with <a href="/dsp/2020/02/07/bad-histogram.html">every exception
I make to this rule</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 4. BMC is nice, but not sufficient</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/design-flow/axixbar-story.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Rule #2 follows from the fact that
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>’s
lint check takes seconds to accomplish and it can find a lot of bugs.  Vivado
might take a minute to start up, or ten minutes to find a bug.  While
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en">SymbiYosys</a> isn’t bad,
<a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys">Yosys</a> doesn’t necessarily flag as many
errors as
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a> does.
As a result, running a lint-check with
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
is my first step when designing any new components.  It’s a quick check, and
anything that doesn’t pass can usually be rewritten and fixed in very short
order.  Even better, unlike the <a href="https://www.verific.com/products/">Verific</a>
based parsers like Vivado and Quartus, it is reasonably possible to generate
a design with
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
that doesn’t have any warnings.</p>

<p>After that first step, though, my next step to component design is a formal
verification step.  This usually starts with either a <code class="highlighter-rouge">cover()</code> check or a
bounded model check (BMC).  <a href="/formal/2018/07/14/dev-cycle.html">I may often switch back and forth between the
two as well as I work with my draft
design</a>.
If everything goes well, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cover()</code> check will tell me how long it takes
my core to accomplish whatever fundamental operation it does, while also
producing traces showing it doing that operation.</p>

<p>The bounded model check is an even easier formal check to run.  With nothing
more than <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">a modest set of bus
properties</a>, it’s usually
easy to run a bounded model check.  Even better, BMC failures are easy to
diagnose and identify from the <a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">VCD
trace</a> generated by the
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en">SymbiYosys</a>.  Indeed, BMC failures are
much easier to diagnose and identify than the phantom bugs in Xilinx’s example
IP that have left <a href="/formal/2019/09/06/axi-story.html">users dealing with hung designs for the last five years, but
that’s another story</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 5. Cover the return to idle</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/design-flow/dcache-story.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>During <a href="/formal/2018/07/14/dev-cycle.html">this time</a> of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">cover()</code> and BMC checking, I’ll be adding any (additional) external interface
requirements the component needs in terms of <code class="highlighter-rouge">assume()</code> statements, until the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">traces</a>
I’m looking at start to look reasonable.  Then, once the
<a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">trace</a>
starts looking realistic I’ll keep going until the BMC proof passes.</p>

<p>Of course, what good is a BMC proof that passes?  All it does is tell you that
your design doesn’t have any bugs in the first <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> timesteps.  What about
timestep <code class="highlighter-rouge">N+1</code>?</p>

<p>How many timesteps do I use for BMC?  That depends upon my patience.  I’ll start
with however long it takes my core to complete an operation or two–hopefully
shorter than forty timesteps or so.  This usually takes a couple of seconds of
processing at first, but then as the design and the proof complexity increase,
I’ll trim that down while <a href="/formal/2019/08/03/proof-duration.html">trying to keep the entire proof at less than 3-4
minutes</a>.  In the
case of my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">AXI DMA
core</a>,
that meant a proof of only four steps.  My
<a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">crossbar’s</a> proof depth was
five steps.  Four or five steps don’t offer you much context when examining any
failing <a href="/blog/2017/07/31/vcd.html">traces</a>.</p>

<p>During <a href="/formal/2018/07/14/dev-cycle.html">this time</a> frame,
as BMC starts to pass at a level equal to my patience level, I’ll switch the
formal tool to doing <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">unbounded
proofs</a>.  <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">Unbounded
proofs</a> are more
difficult to accomplish than bounded model checks since they typically require
more assertions.  At the same time, without the <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">unbounded
proofs</a>,
you might never find counter overflow bugs or recover from the time-step
trimming you did to your BMC proof to keep it within your patience limit.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 6. It's not done until all cover() checks pass</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/design-flow/axi-dma-story.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>As an example, my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">AXI DMA core</a>
has roughly 330 assertions within it.  Only 75 of those come from the
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">bus property set</a>.
The other 252 are necessary for
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
and to make certain that the
<a href="/formal/2019/05/13/axifull.html">bus property set</a>
properly describes the action of the core over time.</p>

<p>Once a design passes the
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">inductive proof</a>,
the task is usually just about done.  The last step is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cover()</code> check.
This check makes certain that any desired transactions remain possible after
all of the interface assumptions you have made.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">cover()</code> check will also
generates a set of waveforms demonstrating the performance of your core that
you can use to advertise the capabilities of the core to others.</p>

<p>Indeed, if you’ve been <a href="https://twitter.com/ZipCPU">following me on twitter</a>,
you may have noticed that I’d tweet examples of these cover traces once the
design got this far.  If you’d like to check out some of these examples,
feel free to browse the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/tree/master/doc/gfx">cover check results I’ve posted for my
AXI cores</a>.  They should
all give you a decent idea of what you might expect from the respective
logic cores–and more importantly what you might expect from a <code class="highlighter-rouge">cover()</code>
check.</p>

<p>A good cover check will verify the complete operation of the core from start
to the completion of its operation followed by a return to idle.  If the
core can handle multiple transactions, the cover check should demonstrate
the core with every pipeline stage full–possibly covering two or more
transactions completed.  Don’t forget to cover the return of your core
to it’s idle state!  (See Fig. 6)</p>

<h2 id="integrating-the-design">Integrating the design</h2>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 7. Integration Design Flow</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/design-flow/integrated.svg" alt="" width="120" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Once all of the components of a given hardware design have been individually
verified, then it’s time to move to integration.  This is the step where I
bring in both
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
and <a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>This is where I will start (and hopefully stop) using any
graphical integration tool that I can’t get rid of.  If I have to,
therefore, this is the step where I would generate a giant user
design that connects to whatever SoC bus interconnects you can connect to.</p>

    <p>This also marks the end of any vendor IP integration flow for me.  I might
still use a synthesis or place–and–route capability, I just find designs
are much easier to debug from RTL than they are with hidden wires and
connection logic throughout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next step in my design flow is done using
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>.
For this step, I generate a Makefile
(<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/autodata/Makefile">Ex</a>)
that does nothing more than create and execute a command to call
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
on the various configuration files.  The master Makefile
(<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic/blob/master/Makefile">Ex</a>) then copies
these build products (if changed) into various locations in the rest of the
design’s directory tree.  If nothing changes, the design doesn’t need to be
rebuilt.</p>

<p>This is why I like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make">(GNU) make</a> over
   a lot of vendor solutions.  Using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make">make</a>,
   I don’t need to “export” any board
   design–<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">AutoFPGA</a>
   has already created any design products I might need.  Indeed, at this point
   I should be able to start building all my support software–even before
   synthesis starts or completes–since the bus components and all <a href="/zipcpu/2019/09/03/address-assignment.html">addresses
   assignments</a>
   will have been laid out.</p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <p>Then, before ever touching a synthesis tool, I run a
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
lint check on the <em>entire</em> design.  As before, this is a quick and easy
check to perform.  Synthesis might take a half an hour, depending upon
the design, but the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
lint check will only take seconds.</p>

    <p>Well, not quite.  I’m actually using
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
to convert my design into a C++
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>
at this step.  It’s still quite fast and easy.</p>

    <p>If this is a <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys">Yosys</a>/<a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr">NextPNR</a>
design, this is also where I build the design implementation and check
timing.  If not, I might start a vendor build tool at this point in the flow.</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <p>Now that
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a> has
built a software library consisting of my design, I’ll build
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>
software to test that design.</p>

    <p>Each hardware component (that I wish to test in
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>)
needs to have an emulator written for it.  This is typically done by hand.</p>

    <p>My <a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>
script is usually quite sparse at this point.  It typically involves
<a href="/blog/2017/06/17/why-network-debugging.html">receiving commands from a TCP/IP port and converting them to an emulated
serial port</a>.
The actual
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>
scripts are programs that would interact with the actual board.  The
<a href="/blog/2017/06/17/why-network-debugging.html">TCP/IP port</a>
helps to convince those programs that they are interacting with the actual
hardware instead of the
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 10. Hardware is always faster</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/design-flow/hires-story.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Are these test scripts complete?  Do they achieve 100% coverage?  Not
   usually.  That was the purpose of the formal test in the last step.
   Instead, the purpose of these tests is just to make certain that everything
   still works when it’s all connected together.</p>

<ol start="5">
  <li>As a final check, or if the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
test takes too long, I’ll switch to running the same tests in hardware.
If the test passes, that’s the end of the story.  If not, I have to slow
down and reconstruct the bug in
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
(if possible).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="bring-up-new-hardware">Bring up new hardware</h2>

<p>It’s not always possible to emulate hardware you’ve never seen.  There’s always
the possibility that you’ve misunderstood the specification and built the
solution to the wrong problem.  The only way to check this is to make certain
that you can actually interact with the real hardware.  From there, you can
back up and tune the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/21/looking-at-verilator.html">Verilator</a>
based emulator to match reality.</p>

<p>So, when working with a new hardware component, the <em>last</em> thing I do is
to write <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
software to interface with that component.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best example of this is working with a <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">new flash
controller</a>.</p>

<p>My first step is to start the design.  This typically sends a series of
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">commands to the flash from the
controller</a>.  I turn these
commands off, then I shut down the main read port of the
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash</a>.
All of this is done by command line.</p>

<p>Then I issue commands, one at a time, from the command line using a program
I’ve called <a href="/blog/2017/06/29/sw-dbg-interface.html">wbregs</a>.
I’ll then examine the results using a
<a href="/blog/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-wbscope.html">WBScope</a>
to see how the
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash</a> responds to the
commands I’ve sent.</p>

<p>Note that I’m not changing my design–I’m just issuing commands to my design
from an external port.  As a result, I can change my command script arbitrarily
without needing to rebuild anything.  I’m the one determining the “script” at
run time as it is.</p>

<p>In the case of the
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash</a>,
I’m usually first trying to read the device’s serial number, then to place it
into QSPI mode to read the first several words from it.  If all goes well, I
should be able to read the synchronization word from the beginning of the
bitstream stored in the first couple addresses of the flash–right where the
vendor provided bit stream still (hopefully) resides.</p>

<p>Only after I start issuing the same commands over and over again in testing
will I set those commands up into a script to spare myself the typing.  In the
case of the flash, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/arrowzip/blob/master/sw/host/flashid.sh">my
script</a>
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">takes the flash off line and out of QSPI
mode</a>,
(or whatever mode it might have been in), reads the device ID register, returns
the device to QSPI mode and then reads the first several words from the
<a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash</a>.
Indeed, you’ll often find <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/arrowzip/blob/master/sw/host/flashid.sh">this
script</a>
still lying around in many of my designs as a piece of abandonware.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/arrowzip/blob/master/sw/host/flashid.sh">the
script</a>,
I’ll move to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/arrowzip/blob/master/sw/host/flashid.cpp">a piece of host
software</a>
to do the same thing but only faster and (IMHO) more professionally.</p>

<p>Once the whole test starts to work, and only then, will I start to create a
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
program that then tries to access and/or control the device.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hardware design and debugging is of necessity a very methodical process.  <a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">FPGA
Hell</a> is very real.  If you
want to avoid it, you can’t really skip steps.  You should always 1) verify
all of your components individually, 2) check that your design will work in
<a href="/blog/2018/08/22/what-is-simulation.html">simulation</a>,
before ever 3) attempting to get it to work in hardware.  Even then, the
first step in hardware shouldn’t be the final software step.  Instead, the
process should remain methodical as each piece of your design is tested,
verified, and brought on line separately.</p>

<p>Some time ago I discussed <a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/20/which-came-first.html">which should come first, the CPU or the peripherals
(and memory)</a>.  I’m
a strong believer that the memory and peripherals should always come before
the CPU–for the sole reason that a design with a CPU within it is just that
much harder to test and verify since there’s that much more that can go wrong.</p>

<p>Of course, some of this bias might have something to do with the fact that
I’ve built (and had to <em>debug</em>) <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">my own
CPU</a>, but
I’ll let you draw your own conclusions on whether or not that’s the case.</p>
