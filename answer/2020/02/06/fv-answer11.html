    <p>Here’s the problem: when using
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>,
the <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
engine is free to start the design in any state it wants subject to the only
constraint that the first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> cycles don’t violate any assumptions
<em>or assertions</em>.  What that means is that your design can start in an
<em>unreachable state</em>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 1. Comparing BMC with Induction</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/bmc-v-induction.png" alt="" width="325" /></td></tr></table>

<p>We discussed this on the blog in the post titled, “<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">An Exercise in Formal
Induction</a>”.
Indeed, that post deals with this same problem just revealed in a different
context.</p>

<p>The trick with using
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
is to make certain that the design can never spend <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> cycles within any
unreachable set of states.  This is the purpose of answers 2 and 3 above.</p>

<p>Of the two, answer 3 is probably my favorite.  If you assert that all the
bits in the two shift registers will be consistent, then you can verify the
design within a cycle or two.  Doing this, however, requires that you
1) have access to all of the signals within the design, 2) either recognize
this problem when creating it or 3) reverse engineer the design you are
verifying enough to realize what’s going on.</p>

<p>This isn’t always possible, in which case answer 2 comes into play.
Answer 2 forces the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> signal to be high often enough that the design
can be verified in about 30 steps.  You could also force <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> to be true
every third step,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nb">past</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nb">past</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span>
	<span class="k">assume</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_ce</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>While this works, it will force the proof to take closer to 45 steps.</p>

<p>If you haven’t tried this exercise, I would encourage you to do so.  Force
the proof length to be short enough that the
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
engine fails, and then examine the traces produced by the
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
engine to see what’s happening.  In
particular, look at the values for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i_ce</code> chosen by the solver.  As the length
gets longer and longer, you’ll see these values tend to stretch like a spring.
It’s a fun exercise, so I’d encourage it.</p>

<p>The first answer above, that of using a different engine, might also work for
you.  This is a great option to use—when you can.  The problem is that some
of these “miracle” engines choke on large designs: you’ll run the solver on your
design for hours on end, get no information about why its taking so long, and
then never know what’s holding it up.  When you eventually kill the solver,
you’ll never know if it would’ve been another 5 seconds until it would’ve
found the solution or another day.  The SMT solvers, on the other hand, can
often press through to a solution–even if they do struggle with the
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
problems such as the one listed above.</p>

<p>A fourth option, not listed in the slide above, is to use
<a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys">Yosys</a> optimizations so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sa[14]</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sb[1]</code> are kept in the same FF.  At that point, the proof becomes trivial
since <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys">Yosys</a> treats the two values as
synonyms for each other.</p>
