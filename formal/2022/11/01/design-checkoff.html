  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve recently had the opportunity to rebuild a <a href="https://www.arasan.com/products/nand-flash/">NAND flash
controller</a> for <a href="https://www.arasan.com">Arasan Chip
Systems, Inc</a>.
The purpose of this redesign was to upgrade an existing flash controller
so that it can process flash requests and commands at even faster speeds than
ever before.  Indeed, this new controller is designed to handle flash chips
that operate at speeds of up to 1.6GB/s while being backwards compatible with
all previous speeds.  Those who know my typical design goals will already
know my personal goals for this design: <em>throughput, throughput, throughput!</em></p>

<p>What I wanted to discuss today, however, was a basic management problem I
came across while working on this project.  At one time, during development,
I was asked by <a href="https://www.arasan.com">Arasan</a>’s management team where I
was at in the project, and how much longer the project would take to
accomplish.</p>

<p>Gosh, where do you start?</p>

<p>First, let’s face reality, despite how much an engineer would like to avoid
such questions, these are valid questions.  Customers have a right to know
how far along you are, and when you think you’ll have the project completed.
In other words, you might not like the question, but it is one that needs
answering.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best and most truthful answer might be, “I’m working on it, and
it’ll get done when it gets done.”  While this might be true, it doesn’t
allow you the ability to express your progress at all.
Customers want to know your timeline, and they want to know that the timeline
you give them is well justified.
Put simply, you need to break projects down into tasks–tasks that need to take
place between now and project completion.  Each task then needs to be given
a time estimate, leading up to an ultimate completion date for each project.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of what such a task list might look like.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1. Example task list table</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/checkoff/tasklist.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>You might find it better to view something like this via a
<a href="https://www.gantt.com/">Gantt chart</a> rather than as a list of independent
tasks, but let’s pull on this idea of a task list a bit more for discussion.
Why?  Because, once the interfaces to a module have been defined, then the
design of each module in a larger system can become an independent task
which can then be separated from the rest of the design. Of course, this
only goes so far: often when designing a module, you will often discover
changes that need to be made to the interface, and some tasks (like
simulation) cannot begin until other tasks complete, but this is still a
good place to start.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of independent tasks is that they can be accomplished
in any order.  Over time, I’ve even found myself walking around in a large
project in a somewhat scatterbrained fashion and doing things out of order.
This leads to two clear problems.  The first is, how shall I know if an
individual task is complete or not?  The second one is like it.  For those
tasks that are not complete, how shall I measure how much of the task
remains?</p>

<p>Answering these questions will be the topic of this article.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-design-progress">Measuring design progress</h2>

<p>The current solution that I came up with to measure design progress involves
building a list of design components (modules), and then discussing their
status in a sort of stop-light chart.  For example, Fig. 2 below shows five
components of a design together with their various states of development.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 2. Module development stoplight chart</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/checkoff/componentlist.svg" alt="" width="780" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Many of the parts and pieces of this example design are already posted on
Github.  For example, you can find the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI
Crossbar</a> or the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilfetch.v">AXI-lite instruction
fetch</a> all
available on line.  You can even find <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">my AXI
DMA</a> on
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU">github</a>.  Other components, such as the “Custom
DMA”, the custom “Micro-Controller”, or the “Top Level Design” listed here,
were not yet built much less posted anywhere.  Each component is then given
a row in this chart, where each column contains a task to be accomplished
before the component is completed.  Each box is then filled in with a color
and a status to describe the reason for the color.</p>

<p>In general, my color scheme follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Red: I color tasks red if either the task <em>not yet started</em>, or if <em>known
problems exist</em> with the task.  Perhaps a formal proof fails.  Perhaps the
component fails in simulation.  Either case would show up here in red.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yellow: Yellow is for partial completion–a <em>work in progress</em>.  To be
yellow, the design component must at least be written, but may not (yet)
pass any verification steps.  When it comes to formal proofs, a yellow box
would indicate that the design passed at one time, but for some reason the
proof needs to be re-run–perhaps because of some changes that have since
been made to the design, perhaps the interface requirements needed to be
updated, or perhaps because a new configuration now needs to be tested.
Whatever the reason, yellow shows progress without yet showing completion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Green: A green box is <em>good to go</em>.  The task is completed.  Both the design
portion is complete, and the given portion of testing has been completed as
well.  No more attention needs to be paid to a green task.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gray: <em>Not applicable</em>.  For example, I tend to only formally verify <em>leaf</em>
components of my designs for complexity reasons.  The top level of a design
rarely sees the light of formal tools, and therefore needs to be tested
via simulation only.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we know the colors, let’s look at the columns.</p>

<p>The first column simply provides an overview of the status of the component.
Is it in development?  If development hasn’t yet started, the component will
be colored in red.  Has the component been verified?  Is it being tested?  Has
it been signed off?  Once a component has received a formal sign off, and hence
is ready for integrated simulation, then I’ll color it green.  All of this is
captured by the first column.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3. Four formal verification steps</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/checkoff/four-keys.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>The next four columns follow from my discussion of the “<a href="/formal/2020/06/12/four-keys.html">Four Keys to getting
your design to work the first
time</a>” article.  These
columns indicate whether or not the design component has passed an interface
check, a contract check, induction, or cover.  In summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>interface check</em> verifies the interfaces the component is supposed to
maintain.  If done well, a formal interface definition can define both
sides of the interface, and so assumptions made in one module can be verified
as assertions on the other side of any interface.</p>

    <p>As an example from Fig. 2, the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilfetch.v">AXI-Lite
fetch</a>
module maintains two interfaces: one with the <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">AXI-Lite
bus</a>, and a second
between the fetch and the CPU.  Both interfaces need to be clearly defined,
and then the design will need to pass a formal property check against this
definition in order for the design to pass this box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>contract check</em> is an internal check, designed to prove that the
design component does what it is supposed to do internally.</p>

    <p>Continuing with the example of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilfetch.v">AXI-Lite
fetch</a>,
the contract check would follow:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>First, pick an arbitrary memory address together with an arbitrary
32-bit value (the instruction) that you will assume be at that address.</p>

        <p>I will also pick another arbitrary bit to decide whether or not reading
from this address will produce a bus error or not.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When the AXI-Lite bus returns an instruction associated with that
address, <em>assume</em> the value returned matches the arbitrary instruction
selected above.  The extra bit will also determine whether or not this
return is OKAY or represents some form of bus error or not.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now <em>prove</em> (i.e. assert) that the instruction passed to the CPU that
is associated with this address matches the arbitrary instruction value
picked earlier.  Or, if the bus returned an error, then assert that the
illegal instruction flag is sent to the CPU with this instruction.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 25px"><caption>Fig 4. My master rule of formal verification</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/checkoff/fv-master-rule.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Note that the check above follows my “master rule” of formal verification:
  Assume inputs, such as the instruction returned by the bus, and then assert
  outputs–such as the instruction returned to the CPU.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html"><em>induction</em></a>
check will give you the confidence you need that your interface and contract
properties are not just held for the first twenty clock periods, but rather
for all time.</p>

    <p>As an example here, it can be a challenge to formally verify that a component
is fully AXI compliant.  There’s just a <em>lot</em> of assertions involved.  If
you only attempt 64-cycles of a bounded model check, then you’ll never know
whether or not your design would fail on the 65th cycle of a 256-beat burst,
or whether or not your design can handle two 32-beat bursts in a row.</p>

    <p>If the component being tested were a cache component, the
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html"><em>induction</em></a>
check might help verify that nothing spoiled the cache between when the
instruction was first returned to the CPU, and when it may have been
returned some time later.  (How long?  Longer than the bound of the proof!)</p>

    <p>For these questions, you will need to pass
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the <em>cover</em> check is left over to make certain that, in spite of
any assumptions you may have made, your design is still able to accomplish
whatever tasks were assigned to it.</p>

    <p>Years ago, when visiting a helicopter squadron, I remember being introduced
to the test pilots of the squadron.  Why would a squadron need test pilots,
I asked?  The helicopters were decades old, and their performance well
established, what was the purpose of the test pilots or the test pilot
section they were members of?  The answer I was given surprised me:
After taking a helicopter apart to fix it, it’s important to shake
it around in a test flight just to make certain everything was properly put
back in place.  In digital design, we might call such a test a “regression”
test.</p>

    <p>In a similar fashion, I use cover checks in a sanity checking role.  There’s
been more than once where I’ve convinced myself that a design passes a
formal verification check, only to discover later that I had erroneously
assumed the design would remain in reset the whole time.  A proper cover
check would’ve failed in this case, which would then lead me to the problem
in my proof.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once all of the various components in a design pass their formal checks, I’ll
then turn to simulation so that I can demonstrate the functionality of the
design.  Note that, at this point, I’m no longer trying to <em>prove</em> the design
works–that’s already been done via formal methods.  Instead, I’m now trying to
<em>demonstrate</em> that the design works.  Frankly, there’s no way I could make any
simulation as thorough as the formal proofs preceding it, but there remain lots
of good reasons for using simulations and bugs that still get caught in this
final step.</p>

<p>The simulation column might also be where I’d include code coverage statistics,
if the project required them.</p>

<p>Some projects have an additional column that I haven’t listed in this chart.
This column would capture whether or not the design as a whole has been
hardware tested and proven.  This might mean that the design has been placed
onto an FPGA, and that it has been demonstrated to work on the FPGA.  It might
also mean that an ASIC has been built from the design.  The important part
here is that, while this is a very useful column, it’s not necessarily
an important check off criteria for all designs.</p>

<p>With that as background, let’s go back and examine Fig. 2 a bit.</p>

<p>As you can see from the list of components, my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axixbar.v">AXI
crossbar</a> has
failed its
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
check and changes have been made to it since it was last
formally verified.  This is evidence of work that needs to be accomplished.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/zipcore/rtl/core/axilfetch.v">AXI-lite instruction
fetch</a>,
however, had only recently been built when I put this chart together.  At the
time, it was still a very new design.  Still, it has passed all of its
property checks, and was then being used in simulation testing.  (It’s now been
used quite successfully in several projects, but that’s another story
for another time.)</p>

<p>The microcontroller in this example, however, had suffered from catastrophic
failures in simulation.  (I had tried to skip the formal checks after making
some minor changes and then to run directly to simulation.  Skipping steps often
feels like you are moving faster, when in this case it meant I had to go back
and do some rework.)  Since bugs had been found in the microcontroller, I
marked it in red so that I would remember to go back and update the formal
proof so these bugs never come back again.</p>

<p>The custom DMA should be self-explanatory–it simply hadn’t (yet) been built,
so it’s line was red through and through.</p>

<p>That brings us to the “Top Level Design” component.  This level will not be
formally verified, and so those boxes have been grayed out.  This is for two
reasons.  First, if everything beneath it was properly verified, then this
level shouldn’t need to be verified at all.  Second, formal verification
depends upon an exhaustive search over all potential states.  This search is
exponentially complex and can easily grow beyond what the designer’s (patience
and) computer power are able to handle.  Therefore, the top level design will
be the focus of a lot of simulation work, but that won’t be able to happen
until all the parts and pieces composing it have been built.</p>

<h2 id="other-uses">Other uses</h2>

<p>Since I started building charts like this one, I’ve found other uses for
building charts like this.  Three particular uses include scheduling, cost
estimation, and explaining design proposals in contract bids.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scheduling</p>

    <p>When scheduling, I’ll place the amount of time in each box that I expect
a task to take.  The sum of all the remaining times in a project should
then be the amount of work time remaining in a project.</p>

    <p>Do I always get this right?  No.  A better question to ask might be whether
I ever get this estimate right at all.  The answer is probably not, but it’s
at least a good first order estimate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cost estimation</p>

    <p>If you can figure out how much time a project will take, then cost
estimation becomes easier.  For most of my projects, the primary cost driver
is engineering time–my own personal time in particular.  Once a time
has been estimated for each of the tasks in the project, all that really
remains is to multiply that time by an hourly rate.</p>

    <p>Tracking the time used in any particular task is also an important part of
estimating such acquisition measures as the <a href="https://www.dau.edu/acquipedia/pages/ArticleContent.aspx?itemid=290">Actual Cost of Work Performed
(ACWP)</a>
or the <a href="https://www.dau.edu/acquipedia/pages/ArticleContent.aspx?itemid=287">Budgeted Cost of Work Performed
(BCWP)</a>
for those customers that require these numbers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contract bids</p>

    <p>Yes, I also use this approach when bidding for contracts as well.</p>

    <p>However, when bidding for contracts, I’ll often list components instead of
components and tasks, and then rearrange those components into something
with more meaning.  Perhaps its a data flow diagram of some type.  Perhaps
its a system block diagram.  Either way, such a diagram then helps me to
illustrate for the customer that I understand the task at hand, while the
stop-light colors help to illustrate the status of the various <a href="/blog/2020/01/13/reuse.html">library
components</a> I might bring to
the project.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In short, I’ve found this stop-light approach very valuable when communicating
with customers.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I’ve now used this component list progress chart for several projects and
purposes.  It has worked so well for me, that I intend to use it again
and again on future projects as the projects and needs allow.</p>
