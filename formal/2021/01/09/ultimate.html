    <p>For many, 2020 was a depressing year.</p>

<p>When my church was closed for a period of time by our governor, however, I
found some valuable things to hold onto.  I discovered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2ANUKSF2BE">theory of
catastrophic plate tectonics</a>,
and learned that it explained many of the puzzles prevalent among those who
believe in an ancient earth.  I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMJRsd8SrhU">Jay Smith’s presentation on the
origins of Islam</a>.  I also
discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ_UxcV-xcM">this video of Dr. Lisle presenting his “Ultimate Proof
of Creation,”</a>
and found it so fascinating that I then bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Proof-Creation-Jason-Lisle/dp/0890515689">his
book</a>.
In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Proof-Creation-Jason-Lisle/dp/0890515689">his book</a>,
he presents the idea of ultimate logic.  I found this idea so
interesting and fascinating, I wanted to share it here.</p>

<p>For those with a Christian background, much of Lisle’s argument follows
from Prov 1:7,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise
wisdom and instruction.
(<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/pro/1/7">Prov 1:7</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, knowledge does not come from an education.  It
doesn’t come from the best schools, the right newspapers, or the right social
media feeds.  The “fear of the LORD” is the beginning of knowledge.  (I also
found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x23w6UPpmSY">this video of Derek Prince presenting what the fear of the LORD is in
the first place</a> during the COVID
lockdowns, but I digress.)  For those who would argue that science forms the
basis for knowledge, I watched what science did this year with certain studies
of COVID and hydroxychloroquine.  These observations confirmed that science
itself is founded upon honesty.  Science cannot prove the necessity of honesty,
and so science cannot be the beginning of knowledge.</p>

<p>For those who are not Christians, the rest of the discussion focuses more on
the idea of and development of ultimate logic in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-background">A Quick Background</h2>

<p>Let’s start out by defining some terms used when describing logic.  In logic,
premises are presented and used to draw a conclusion.  The progression from
premises to conclusion is called an argument.  A picture might help, so let’s
consider Fig. 1.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1. The form of an argument</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate/logic-form.svg" alt="" width="560" /></td></tr></table>

<p>When working with <a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SymbiYosys</a>,
the assumptions within your logic file form the premises and the various
assertions form the logical conclusions we wish to draw.  The solver then works
from the premises to either prove the conclusion, or to come up with an example
that proves the conclusion invalid.</p>

<p>The entire process is important for understanding this idea of ultimate logic,
but to get there I need to first point out that this background discussion
isn’t really complete since we haven’t listed all of the assumptions required
for such a proof.</p>

<h2 id="digging-deeper-into-the-assumptions">Digging deeper into the assumptions</h2>

<p>Did you notice any of the missing assumptions?  Here are some assumptions that
we typically miss when building a formal proof of hardware correctness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The RTL logic within the design itself constitutes a set of assumptions in
addition to the explicit ones.  This makes sense, but it’s not normally
something we think about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also assume that <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys">Yosys</a> accurately
translates our logic and formal statements without error into something the
solver can handle.  This is a great assumption, <a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/SymbiYosys/issues/111">until
it isn’t true</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We assume the formal solver works.  That is, when the formal solver proves
something, no counter examples exist.  <em>None.</em></p>

    <p>A corollary assumption that when the solver declares a proof invalid that it
truly is invalid isn’t typically as critical.  In that case, the solver is
required to provide an example proving that the proof is invalid and
such examples are easily dealt with.  The result, on a good day, will be
a bug report in solver that will then get fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here’s a tricky underlying assumption as well: A valid proof today of the
logic within our design will remain a valid proof until the assumptions
change.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While Lisle focuses on this last assumption, he goes deeper as well.  How do
we know that the assumptions of any given proof are valid in the first place?</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 2. Assumptions get verified when you verify the second module</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate/twin-module.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>In digital design, many assumptions can be validated in a straightforward
fashion as shown in Fig. 2.  First, when any two components interact, any
properties of the inputs to the one will be assumed and the outputs will
be asserted.  Then, when verifying the module it interacts with, that module
will have its inputs assumed and its outputs asserted.  By swapping the
assumptions on the inputs of the one to be assertions on the outputs of the
other, the assumptions can be proven.  This ultimately forms a proof of
our assumptions.</p>

<p>As a caution, let me remind you to verify only one module at a time.  As we’ve
discovered earlier, <a href="/formal/2018/12/18/skynet.html">if you make assumptions about things within a module you
might void the proof</a>.</p>

<p>That deals with some of the formal assumptions within logic design, but what
about the others?</p>

<h2 id="modus-ponens-and-the-invalid-proof-of-the-ultimate">Modus Ponens and the Invalid Proof of the Ultimate</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens"><em>Modus Ponens</em></a> is a Latin name
for a specific argument that, in my mind, helps explain the need for an
ultimate premise.  The argument is fairly basic: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P|-&gt;Q</code> (P implies Q), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code>
(P is true), therefore <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Q</code> (our conclusion) must be true as well.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 3. Modus Ponens</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate/modus-ponens.svg" alt="" width="320" /></td></tr></table>

<p>A common, but related, fallacy is one where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P|-&gt;Q</code> and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Q</code>, and so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code>
is concluded.  This fallacy is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent"><em>Affirming the
Consequent</em></a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 4. Affirming the Consequent</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate/scientific-proof.svg" alt="" width="320" /></td></tr></table>

<p>How common is this fallacy?  Well, if you think about it, is this not the
entire basis of the scientific method?  The scientist considers the evidence
before him and makes a theory about the world.  He then forms an experiment
that will have a particular outcome if his theory is true.  In formal form,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code> would be the theory and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Q</code> a favorable outcome from the experiment.  If
the experiment comes out as he predicts, this <em>does not</em> confirm his
hypothesis.  <em>It cannot.</em>  At best, all the scientific method can do is reject
hypotheses which do not match the evidence.  It cannot confirm or prove a
hypothesis because it matches the evidence because to do so would be the
fallacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent"><em>affirming the
consequent</em></a>.</p>

<p>Let’s back up to <em>Modus Ponens</em>, however, and ask ourselves, how do we know that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code> is true in the first place?  Perhaps because a more fundamental premise
is true, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P0</code>, and because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P0</code> is true therefore we know that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code> is true.
But what about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P0</code>?  How shall we know that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P0</code> is true?  Because it depends
upon <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P1</code>?</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 5. Modus Ponens to Absurdity</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate/modus-absurdem.svg" alt="" width="320" /></td></tr></table>

<p>We could repeat this logic and repeat this logic and repeat this logic and
the result would be that we would never truly prove anything.  There <em>must</em>
be a first premise.  This we shall call the <em>Ultimate</em> premise.</p>

<h2 id="the-ultimate-premise">The Ultimate Premise</h2>

<p>Lisle then asks, what about the rules of logic themselves?  How shall logic
itself be proven?  Why should we accept that <em>Modus Ponens</em> is a valid argument?
Likewise, if <em>Modus Ponens</em> is valid today, will it remain valid again
tomorrow?  If so, why?</p>

<p>In math, I learned to handle such arguments using axioms.  An axiom is
something that isn’t otherwise proven.  We just accept them as true.  For
example, two axioms I remember include 1) there exists a zero and 2) every
integer has a successor.  The problem with just accepting axioms as true is
that doing so is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrariness">arbitrary</a>.
In other words, why should I accept your axioms as
true and not someone else’s?</p>

<p>As a good example of this, how often have you heard a statement such as,
“My [insert favorite politician] is honest, but [the opposition party] is
not”?  Another good example would be that parallel lines never cross.
Such statements are made as axioms with no argument offered as their
basis.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 6. Circular logic is known as Begging the question</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ultimate/circular.svg" alt="" width="360" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Such logic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrariness"><em>arbitrary</em></a>,
and <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/job/38/1">therefore proves
nothing</a>.  How then shall the
truth of competing axioms be weighed against each other to know which are
in fact true?</p>

<p>A better definition of an axiom would be a <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">“self-evident”
truth</a>.  This is
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/axiom">Mirriam-Websters’s</a>
second meaning of the word, and perhaps the best one for this context.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, declaring something to be true because it is true is a known
fallacy called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question">begging the
question</a>”, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning">circular reasoning</a>.</p>

<h2 id="proving-the-ultimate-premise">Proving the Ultimate Premise</h2>

<p>Ultimate proofs, Lisle argues, have the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> therefore <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> yet
<em>without being either circular or fallatious.</em></p>

<p>As an example of this, Lisle presents an existence proof for whether or not
such ultimate arguments could be even exist.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Premise: Rules of logic apply</li>
  <li>Conclusion: Rules of logic apply</li>
</ol>

<p>This proof is not circular because to argue otherwise would render you
unable to draw any conclusion at all, leading to complete foolishness.
Indeed, you <em>cannot</em> argue against the rules of logic without first using
the rules of logic to make your argument.  This therefore is a proof of the
rules of logic based upon those same rules yet without being circular.</p>

<p>How shall we know, however, that the rules of logic that apply today shall
apply again tomorrow in the same fashion?  Here again, the proof follows
from an ultimate premise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>God is true and unchanging. (The ultimate premise, drawn from the Bible
(See <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mal/3/6">Mal 3:6</a>
and <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/3/33">John 3:33</a>)</li>
  <li>Rules of logic follow from God’s nature.</li>
  <li>Therefore, the rules of logic will remain unchanged again tomorrow.</li>
</ol>

<p>Worldviews that are not founded upon God as their ultimate premise cannot make
this argument.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Lisle makes several other claims as well which cannot be explained by a secular
world view.  For example, if there are no ultimate moral standards then by what
standard would you judge my conduct right or wrong?  If you cannot judge
the conduct of another as either right or wrong, then upon what basis is
justice founded?  What basis would you then have for requiring one action or
another of someone else?  On the other hand, if there are absolute standards
of right and wrong, then what is their basis?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Proof-Creation-Jason-Lisle/dp/0890515689">His book</a>,
however, is really about the ultimate proof of <em>creation</em>: the conclusion
that <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/exo/20/11">God made the world in six days and rested on the
seventh</a>, and that He did
so roughly six thousand years ago.  Any science attempting to prove otherwise,
Lisle argues, must be <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2pe/3/4">based upon the premise that the natural processes we
observe today have continued unchanging from the past to the
present</a>.  This conclusion,
however, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrariness">arbitrary</a>
and without basis.  Just because we see nothing but
natural processes today doesn’t mean that supernatural processes never existed.
A separate conclusion, made on the basis of recorded observations throughout
human history, is also available to us.  According to recorded history, God
did in fact create the world as He said He did, and further that <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/3/33">His record
is true and accurate</a>.  This
record includes <a href="/blog/2018/04/01/resurrection-day.html">supernatural events which cannot be refuted
today</a> apart from
resorting to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrariness">arbitrary</a> or even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning">circular logic</a>.  (i.e., the
supernatural cannot happen therefore it didn’t.  But why couldn’t it have taken
place?  Because.)</p>
