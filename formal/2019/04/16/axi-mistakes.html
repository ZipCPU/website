  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Some time ago, <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">I posted a set of formal properties which could be used to
verify any AXI-lite interface, slave or
master</a>.  I then applied
these properties to the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/xlnxdemo.v">AXI-lite slave
core</a>
generated by <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Xilinx’s
Vivado</a> and found
<a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">multiple errors within their
core</a>.</p>

<p>This wasn’t enough to convince me, however, to that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_slave.v">these
properties</a>
could be used broadly across many projects and designs.  So <a href="/blog/2019/01/12/demoaxilite.html">I built my own
AXI-lite slave core</a>
using <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_slave.v">these properties</a>.
Using <a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a> together with a
<a href="/formal/2019/02/21/txuart.html">poor man’s cover sequence</a>,
I could demonstrate that my core not only had less latency than
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/xlnxdemo.v">Xilinx</a>’s
(once the bugs were fixed), but I could also demonstrate that <a href="/blog/2019/01/12/demoaxilite.html">my own
AXI-lite core</a>
had twice the data throughput.</p>

<p>So it works on two slave cores.  What about more complicated designs?</p>

<p>On a whim, I recently built an <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilxbar.v"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NxM</code> AXI-lite
interconnect</a>
that can connect any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> AXI-lite masters to any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> AXI-lite slaves, with up
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min(N,M)</code> active connections at any given time.  I used both my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_slave.v">AXI-lite slave</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/faxil_master.v">master property
sets</a>
to prove that <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axilxbar.v">this
interconnect</a>
would obey the rules of the road for the bus.  (It can also maintain the high
throughput rate of one transaction request or response per clock when using my
own <a href="/blog/2019/01/12/demoaxilite.html">AXI-lite slave core</a>,
but that’s another discussion for another day.)</p>

<p>I then knew that my <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">formal property
set</a> would work on not only
basic AXI-lite slaves with only one or two transactions ever outstanding, but
also on any number of arbitrary AXI-lite slaves driven by any
number of arbitrary AXI-lite masters.  The only rule for success was that the
slaves needed to follow <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">these formal
properties</a>.</p>

<p>But this was all my own code.  Would <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">these
properties</a>
apply equally well to the designs of others?</p>

<p>So, just for fun and to give <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">these
properties</a> some exercise,
I’ve been wandering <a href="https://forums.xilinx.com">Xilinx’s Forums</a>, just looking
for an example AXI-lite core that can be <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">formally
verified</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a biased sample set, since no one submits their code to an
<a href="https://forums.xilinx.com">on-line forum</a> unless they can’t get it
to work.  Sometimes this means the code is written by a hobbyist who doesn’t
care about whether or not his code gets released.  At other times, its
submitted by a (not always so) junior engineer who is so <a href="/blog/2017/05/19/fpga-hell.html">frustrated by trying
to get a design to work</a>
that he’s ready to do anything just to get some help.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the problem is compounded by the prevalence of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>+<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
chips as well as the other <a href="/doc/axi-spec.pdf">AXI</a>
based architectures which force you to use such a
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">complicated</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a> interface to your design.
In many of the examples I’ve found, the poster is frustrated because
he feels like he is connecting his (working) code to a black box that he
doesn’t necessarily or completely understand, and worse to one that he
can’t examine.  What then would you conclude when it doesn’t work?</p>

<p>So I thought I might share today the most common bug I’ve come across while
examining the AXI-lite designs of others.</p>

<h2 id="the-most-common-bug">The most common bug</h2>

<p>Let me get straight to the point: here’s the bug in Verilog form, as I found
it in <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/bench/formal/xlnxdemo.v">Xilinx’s AXI-lite example
core</a>:</p>

	<span class="c1">// design is already buggy</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here’s the same bug (again) in their (full) AXI example slave core, this one
taken from <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado
2018.3</a>:</p>

	<span class="c1">// The design is now broken</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I won’t continue either of these examples, because the code is already buggy
at this point.</p>

<p>While the examples above are shown with respect to the write address and data
channels, it can be found on any channel.  This includes not only the read
address channel, but also the write acknowledgment and read return channels.
Specifically, this bug can often be found in any design using a <a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">basic
handshaking</a>
protocol.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason why this bug is so common is because it’s prevalent in
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a>’s example code.  For example, here it is
again in the example AXI-lite slave generated from <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado
2018.3</a>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">S_AXI_ACLK</span> <span class="p">)</span>

				<span class="n">axi_wready</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">S_AXI_WVALID</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="c1">// Again, the design is now broken</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here’s the problem: <em>the rest bus logic depends upon <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*VALID</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*READY</code>
alone!</em>  Both the bus master and the interconnect will move on to the next
state in the bus transaction any time both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*VALID</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*READY</code> are true,
<em>irrespective of whether or not any other slave-imposed conditions are also
valid</em>.  Hence, if you condition your response to
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
on anything other than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*VALID</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*READY</code>, you code may easily miss
transactions.</p>

<p>Yes, this has bit me too.</p>

<p>Back when I was working on a <a href="/blog/2018/02/09/first-cyclonev.html">Cyclone-V
design</a>, I
discovered that missed or dropped transactions would lock up my design
so hard that there would be nothing to do but cycle the power.  (No, the
reset button didn’t work.)  While I can’t say the same would happen in a
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> design, I can safely say that the
consequences of these mistakes are <em>not</em> benign.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-the-bug">Avoiding the bug</h2>

<p>The reason why this bug is common is that a designer will look at the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*VALID</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*READY</code> signals and say to himself, but I only want to act on
these signals if I’m not already busy, or only if some other operation is
complete.</p>

<p>Adding conditions to the transaction test, such as what we’ve seen in the
examples above, is not the way to solve this problem.</p>

<p>What you want to do instead is to make certain that any time you are not ready
for the next transaction, you are then holding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*READY</code> line low.</p>

<p>Using <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>,
this is as easy as adding another property to your proof, or rather one
property for every condition you want to accept on.  For example, if we
were looking at the write address channel, and we wanted to condition on
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">something_else</code>, you’d then want to change your code from,</p>

<p>with the added formal property,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">S_AXI_ACLK</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="n">something_else</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can also express this same property using an immediate assertion, as in:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">something_else</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice how I’m not placing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXI_AWVALID</code> in this check.  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXI_AWVALID</code>
is one of the incoming signals to your design–one you have no control over.
It makes more sense, therefore, to check against <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXI_AWREADY</code> alone since
this is the one signal in this group that you do have control over.</p>

<p>If this property passes <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
verification</a>, you
can then remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">something_else</code> from your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> condition with confidence,
knowing that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">something_else</code> will always be true anytime <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*READY</code> is true, and
so it no longer needs to be tested by your logic.  This will also simplify
your design, leaving more logic resources available for other tasks.</p>

<h2 id="the-second-form">The Second Form</h2>

<p>You may also see this same bug in another form.  Consider this following
snippet of code, also generated automatically by
<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado</a>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">S_AXI_ACLK</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="c1">// Code is now buggy</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this case the question you need to ask yourself is, what will
your design do when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXI_AWVALID &amp;&amp; S_AXI_AWREADY</code>
are both true <em>at the same time</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXI_BVALID &amp;&amp; S_AXI_BREADY</code> are true?</p>

<p>There are two options to fix this form of the problem.  First, you could
use <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
to prove that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXI_BVALID</code> would never be true when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S_AXI_AWREADY</code> was true,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="k">property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">S_AXI_ACLK</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="o">|-&gt;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">S_AXI_BVALID</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Alternatively, you could write your code to handle both conditions:</p>

<p>This bug is not specific to <a href="/doc/axi-spec.pdf">AXI</a>
peripherals by any means.  You might also find this bug within
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/05/29/simple-wishbone.html">slave peripherals</a>.
Indeed, the <a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">basic handshake is a very common design
component</a>
and it’s important to learn how to do it right.</p>

<p>No, I’m not done discussing the <a href="/doc/axi-spec.pdf">AXI</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a> just yet.
I’d like to come back and discuss <a href="/doc/axi-spec.pdf">AXI</a>
some more, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15">should the Lord
permit</a>.  For example, I’ve just
recently managed to <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally
verify</a>
both Xilinx’s AXI (full, not lite) example core as well as <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/demofull.v">my own brand-new
AXI (full) slave
core</a>, and I
think it might be valuable to share this solution with others and to show
you how to do it.  Further, the <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
verification</a> <a href="/formal/2018/12/28/axilite.html">solution
I’ve presented for Verilog
designs</a> can also be
applied to VHDL designs using the <a href="https://www.symbioticeda.com/seda-suite">Symbiotic EDA
Suite</a>, and I’d like to show
how to verify a VHDL design using the same tools as well.  Indeed, it’s really
not all that much harder, but there are a few interesting twists necessary
to make it happen.</p>
