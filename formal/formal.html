        </h2><DIV ID=<post-meta"><P>The pre-fetch module is one of the fundamental components of any CPU.  It is responsible for fetching instructions from memory.  The ZipCPU prefetch is also an example of a Wishbone master, something worth looking at again in and of itself.  This post adds a twist, though, to those two topics in that we'll also formally prove that this prefetch algorithm properly accesses the Wishbone bus.</P></DIV>

        </h2><DIV ID=<post-meta"><P>The most critical component of any bus based system, such as a System on a Chip (SoC), is the bus interface.  One failure of this interface can easily lock up the entire system.  This post examines the Wishbone bus interface, and presents some formal properties that can be used to verify that a Wishbone master works.</P></DIV>

        </h2><DIV ID=<post-meta"><P>I've just started trying formal verification methods based upon yosys and yosys-smtbmc this week.  As a result, I've now found several subtle bugs within my FIFOs, things that I would never have found otherwise.  This post shares some of my initial thoughts and experiences, as well as providing a short primer to the method.</P></DIV>
