<p>When I first started working with <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
verification</a>,
I was used to <a href="/zipcpu/2017/12/28/ugliest-bug.html">chasing bugs in FPGA hardware
implementations</a>.
While difficult, I figured <a href="/blog/2017/06/02/design-process.html">this was just how things
worked</a>.</p>

<p>Now, after working with <a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/">SymbiYosys</a>
since 2017, I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve now had several designs work
the very first time they were tried in actual FPGA hardware.</p>

<p>One of the first examples of such a design was my <a href="/blog/2019/05/29/demoaxi.html">AXI-lite
slave</a>.  I offered it as an
example to someone who was struggling to make <a href="/blog/2019/01/12/demoaxilite.html">Xilinx’s example
work</a>, and mine “just
worked” for him.  No, I never told him that it had never before been tried in
real hardware, nor that it had never before been tried with Vivado, still it
“just worked.”</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 2. Unexpected "features" in Xilinx's S2MM controller</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/four-keys/xilinx-s2mm.svg" alt="" width="320" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Then, about three weeks ago, I learned of another example.  [RLEE287]
<a href="https://github.com/rlee287/hdl_snippets/wiki/Xilinx-AXI-DMA-(7.1)-Bug">was struggling
with</a>
what turned out to be an unexpected “feature” of <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/axi_datamover/v5_1/pg022_axi_datamover.pdf">Xilinx’s AXIS2MM
core</a>,
and so he had taken my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/aximm2s.v">AXIMM2S</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axis2mm.v">AXIS2MM</a>
designs and incorporated them into his own work.  He then placed the
designs within an FPGA, and sure enough my two components “just worked.”</p>

<p>Now, here’s the hidden secret behind that test: I’d never tried these even
more complicated designs in hardware before either.  Nope, not at all.  The
only thing I’d done was to formally verify the design.  (Well, okay, that
and a <a href="/blog/2020/04/08/axitb.html">little bit of a simulation
check</a>–which both cores had
previously passed.)</p>

<p>Indeed, I’m now spending a lot <a href="/blog/2020/04/01/design-flow.html">less time chasing bugs in hardware than I
ever was before</a>.  Unlike
before, where I was used to struggling to find a broken needle in a haystack of
traces using a straw called an <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">internal logic
analyzer</a> for glasses,
I’m now fixing bugs <a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/">found by a
tool</a> that tells me exactly where the bug
is and gives me a very short trace illustrating the bug.  Needless to say,
bug hunting has gotten a lot easier.</p>

<h2 id="four-keys-to-getting-a-design-that-just-works">Four Keys to getting a design that “Just Works”</h2>

<p>If I were to try to turn this into a formula for success, I’d argue that there
are four key components common to each of these successes, as illustrated in
Fig. 1 above: A formal contract, interface property sets, functional
coverage checking, and induction.  Let’s discuss each of these briefly in turn.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 3. AXI DMA and what happens when you skip the contract check</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/four-keys/axidma-contract.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Formal “Contract”</strong></p>

    <p>A common thread among all of my “successful first time” components is
that they have all been verified against a formal “contract”.  This
“contract” is unique to each component, and follows an application (not
component) specific form.  The contract fundamentally describes the
underlying nature of the component.  For example, when writing data
to a memory, there should be a <a href="/zipcpu/2018/07/13/memories.html">series of
formal properties describing the logic path from the bus to the memory and
back again</a>.  When
verifying a <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash
controller</a>,
there should be a property expressing every step involved in reading from
the flash all the way up to the bus return.  When verifying a CPU,
the contract should follow an instruction through the pipeline and verify
that the “right thing” happens at every step.  The “contract” is really
a fundamental part of any formal proof.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interface Property Sets</strong></p>

    <p>All interfaces between internal design components should be verified
against an interface property set.  This is perhaps most pronounced with
bus interfaces, but it applies to other interfaces as well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 4. Custom property sets</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/four-keys/custom-property-story.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>Before <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">I started formally
   verifying</a> my
   designs, it wasn’t uncommon to have a design that somehow dropped a bus
   request that would then hang the whole bus.  This is one of the reasons
   why I really like <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone’s ability to “abort” a bus
   cycle</a>–a feature <a href="/blog/2020/03/14/axi-reset.html">not
   present in AXI</a>.  I would
   then attempt to recover the design by aborting the broken cycle (dropping
   the CYC line before the last ACK).  Once aborted, I could then return to the
   bus and read from my <a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-scope.html">Wishbone
   Scope</a> to find out
   what had happened.  Without the abort, I wouldn’t have been able to access
   the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">WB scope</a> at all following a bus
   fault.</p>

<p>Since I’ve started formally verifying all of my bus component designs,
   I’ve stopped needing to abort transactions in order to rescue a bus.
   I’m simply just not struggling with bus faults like this anymore.  Well,
   there was an exception at one time due to a <a href="/blog/2017/06/22/simple-wb-interconnect.html">fault in the
   interconnect</a>,
   dating back to before I <a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">formally verified my
   interconnect</a>.  There
   was also another exception due to a <a href="/blog/2018/11/03/soc-fpga.html">faulty bus property
   set</a>, but these
   tend to be the rare exceptions rather than the rule.</p>

<p>Let me also add another lesson learned here from building the
   <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>.  In every <a href="/zipcpu/2018/03/21/dblfetch.html">instruction
   fetch component</a>, and
   in every data memory component, I found myself duplicating interface
   properties describing the interface between the CPU and the respective
   memory controller.  This left me with the hassle of visually inspecting
   each property within the memory controllers to make sure there was a
   corresponding one within the CPU, as well as struggling with version
   controlling these properties since I had so many copies of them across
   the design.  Had I instead just created a single custom formal property set
   to describe the instruction fetch interface, and another one for the data
   memory controller, managing the properties would’ve been so much easier.</p>

<p>My point?  Interface property sets are awesome!  They make an easy
   addition to any project, and they can really help isolate and abstract
   components that should be working together.</p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <p><strong>Functional coverage</strong></p>

    <p>My third rule is that you need to be able to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cover()</code> every possible
operation the component is supposed to accomplish.  This helps to flush
out careless assumptions that might otherwise prevent the proof from being
valid.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 5. Cover the return to idle</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/four-keys/idle-return.svg" alt="" width="320" /></td></tr></table>

<p>As examples, a
   <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">flash controller</a>,
   should be able to request a value from the device and return the response.
   It should be able to request a second value, in quick succession and return
   that too.  In both cases, you want to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cover()</code> the return of the design
   back to idle.</p>

<p>Likewise, a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/pfcache.v">CPU
   cache</a>
   should be able to make a memory request, get the result, and return it to
   the CPU–with appropriate assertion checking along the way of course.  The
   CPU itself should be able to retire instructions of each basic category.
   Cover requests should include requests for items in the cache as well
   as items not in the cache.  They should include requests for cachable
   memory, as well as I/O memory–as well as multiple requests in short
   succession.</p>

<p>An SDRAM component should be able to properly reset the device, activate
   a row, and then read or write from a column of memory.  It should even be
   able to activate a second row and read or write from that row while working
   with the first.  <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipstormmx/blob/e4cb3e6f3bc3ac5831925b28116cb19b4ed09e8d/rtl/wbsdram.v#L1117-L1170">My own cover checks</a>
   go farther to check that, after working with one row, the memory should be
   able to switch rows or even issue a refresh command.</p>

<p>The fun part of this functional coverage check is that the result is a trace
   showing how well the core works.  Usually I’ll just cover the 3rd or 4th
   return from a bus slave, which then reveals the throughput of the core.
   I’ve since used these traces often when advertising the operation of the
   core.  I’ve used them when explaining to users how the core works.  Indeed,
   if you check the
   <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/tree/master/doc/gfx"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doc/gfx</code></a>
   directories of some of my repositories, you are likely to find the results
   of any cover checks of more recent cores.  <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/doc/gfx/axidma.png">Here, for example, is a
   trace</a>
   drawn from my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">AXIDMA
   core</a>
   showing it’s ability to maintain 100% AXI throughput even when crossing
   burst boundaries.</p>

<p>When should cover be checked?  Some engineers check it early in the
   verification process.  <a href="/formal/2018/07/14/dev-cycle.html">While I’ve done
   that</a>, <a href="/blog/2020/04/01/design-flow.html">my focus on
   cover checks is typically the last step in the
   process</a>–something
   that makes the cover check feel like the icing on the cake of a new design.
   This “icing” helps to prove that, not only does the design not violate any
   interface rules, but also that it has been well designed.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 15px"><caption>Fig 6. Only induction can verify a design for all time</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/four-keys/induction-results.png" alt="" width="417" /></td></tr></table>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <p><strong>Induction</strong></p>

    <p>The fourth ingredient that has been common among my “successes” is that
I insist that all my designs must pass an <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction
check</a>.
A bounded model check (BMC) will only ever prove that your design can handle
some number of initial clock cycles without any error.  The <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction
check</a>, if
passed, will additionally prove that your design will never violate any
properties within the design.  Never.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 7. The UART Transmitter</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/four-keys/extra-uarttx.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This proof is subject, of course, to the hardware implementing your logic
   properly but that’s really another story.  For this reason, we’ll avoid any
   discussion here of the very real problems asssociated with manufacturing
   flaws, power dropouts, <a href="/blog/2017/09/14/even-i-get-stuck.html">PLLs that don’t lock
   properly</a>, or the
   unique problems associated with extra-terrestrial environments.  Barring
   such faults, a design passing an <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction
   check</a>
   will never violate any of your safety properties (i.e. your assertions)
   for all time.</p>

<p>When starting out with a new design, I try to start out with a proof length
   equal to or greater than the length of a core operation–whatever that is
   for the particular design at hand.  Sometimes I can start with two
   operations, although it really depends upon the core.  Not every design
   can fit in this mold.  AXI bursts, for example, can be up to 256 beats in
   length, and checking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure">back
   pressure</a> can require a
   many more steps than that.  AXI is a complicated protocol, however, and
   so I struggle to complete a proof much longer than 50 steps or so.
   Sometimes even 10 steps is too hard.  As a result, few of my AXI proofs
   are longer than 20 steps, and the more complex proofs are even smaller.
   For example, <a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">my AXI
   crossbar</a> proof only
   requires 5 steps, whereas the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/axidma.v">AXI
   DMA</a> proof
   requires only 3 steps.  Short but complete proofs like this are only
   possible when using
   <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>.</p>

<p>What sorts of problems get caught with <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction
   checks</a>?
   The big things seem to be counter or buffer overflows, but the list could
   go on quite a ways.  For example, any
   <a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">crossbar</a> needs to keep
   track of the number of outstanding transactions so that it can know
   when to adjust it’s arbitration rules.  What will verify the logic
   required to keep this counter from overflowing?  That’s something that you
   can typically only check using
   <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left; padding: 20px"><caption>Fig 8. Verification vs Validation</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/four-keys/verification-vs-validation.svg" alt="" width="320" /></td></tr></table>

<p>At the same time, I’ll admit that <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction
   checks</a>
   offer diminishing returns.  Towards the end of any project, most of the
   <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
   faults will be caused by missing assertions rather than broken logic.
   Still, until the design passes an <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">inductive
   check</a>,
   you don’t have any confidence of anything truly “working”, and a design
   that “just works” when it gets to hardware is very valuable.</p>

<p>What about the designs that pass these four steps but still don’t work?
I have had a few of those, though not many.  Typically that’s caused by
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/tree/master/doc/examples/hdmi-eddc">implementing the wrong interface to an external hardware component</a>–a
validation problem rather than a verification one.  More often, I have
the problem where the design works but doesn’t quite work as well as I
might like, as illustrated by Fig. 7 above, or even our recent <a href="/blog/2020/04/08/axitb.html">AXI test bench
discussion</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-this-really-work">Does this really work?</h2>

<p>I dislike advertising “gimmicks” as much as the next guy, and the wonderful
“works every time” description above just didn’t sit right with me, so after
writing it down I sat on it.  Indeed, I sat on the above description for about
two weeks before bringing it back up to finish it today.</p>

<p>Back when I wrote about those four steps to perfection, I was very much feeling
on top of my game.  I had finally figured out this thing called digital logic
design.  I knew how to achieve success with a perfect formula!  Not only
that, my designs were better than those of the big boys out there!  Yeah,
now that’s quite a feeling of success.</p>

<p>Then there’s what happened next.  It kind of put my swollen head back into
its proper shape.</p>

<p>To set the background, let me explain that I was building a new AXI based
NOR flash design component for a client.  I had followed all of the various
steps above, and so I had a lot of confidence that my design worked.  The core
design passed an <a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction
check</a>.  I
had cover checks for all the operations.  I had an AXI property set I was
verifying everything against, and I had created bi-directional interface
property sets for (most of) the interfaces within.  Not only that, I had a
simulation set up that was demonstrating every capability this core was
supposed to perform.</p>

<p>Yes, I was truly convinced the design worked.</p>

<p>My client wasn’t.  He wanted some more convincing.  He wanted me to
demonstrate the design on actual hardware.  Sure, simulation feels really
good but somehow it’s just not the same thing.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 9. Adding test infrastructure</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/four-keys/uut-demo.svg" alt="" width="680" /></td></tr></table>

<p>So, like any good engineer, I built a complete design around this component
to test it.  The design, once put together, looked something like
Fig. 9 above, and most of the extra components were from designs I’d already
built in the past.  Basically, a serial port would enter into the design and
the data from that port would get converted into AXI bus commands–a process
I like to call a “<a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging
bus</a>”.  Those
commands then went into an <a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">AXI
crossbar</a>.  Connected to the
<a href="/blog/2019/07/17/crossbar.html">crossbar</a> were both the
Unit Under Test (UUT), as well as <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip/blob/master/rtl/demofull.v">my AXI slave
design</a>
being used to control a block RAM.  I needed the block RAM device to be
a DMA destination for the UUT, but that’s another story.  My point here is,
there’s a lot of stuff going on in just this minimal test.  Oh, and the
“<a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus</a>”?
Yeah, that’s shown in red in Fig. 9 above for a good reason.  You’ll see in a
moment.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when I fired up the whole design–it didn’t work.</p>

<p>Perhaps I <a href="/fpga-hell.html">shouldn’t have been surprised</a>,
but I was certainly humbled.</p>

<p>What went wrong?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Things started out so badly that not even <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">my debugging
bus</a>
was working.  I had no way of <a href="/blog/2017/06/16/dbg-bus-forest.html">talking to my
design</a>,
and couldn’t tell what was going wrong.</p>

    <p>Indeed, I was humbled all the way back down to <a href="http://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/05/24/serial-port.html">using blinky to debug my
design</a>.</p>

    <p>I eventually found the first problem in the top level of the design.  As
you may recall, my top level designs are typically just <a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">wrapper
component</a>
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/10/05/autofpga-intro.html">where I place all of the various “hard-block” vendor
components</a> that
I can’t simulate.  These don’t get verified either.</p>

    <p>Inside this top level component I had set the design’s reset wire so
that it would reset the design any time the PLLs were locked–rather
than the other way around–holding the design in reset <em>until</em> the PLLs
locked.</p>

    <p>Ouch.  Surely that was the last bug before the <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging
bus</a>
worked again?  Not nearly.  Once fixed, I was still stuck <a href="http://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/05/24/serial-port.html">using blinky
for debuggnig some
more</a>–just not much
longer (thankfully).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next thing I noticed was that my <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging
bus</a>
wasn’t <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/06/19/debug-idles.html">producing
“idle” characters</a>.
This meant that the <a href="/formal/2019/02/21/txuart.html">serial
port</a> wasn’t working.
This I managed to trace to a confusion in the clock rate, created by not
being certain whether I wanted to use the 82.5MHz MIG produced clock rate
or the external 100MHz clock input.  The design was using the 100MHz clock
rate.  The serial port was calculating it’s clock division based upon the
82.5MHz rate.  As a result, the <a href="/formal/2019/02/21/txuart.html">serial
port</a> was running at
the wrong baud rate.</p>

    <p>This got me closer.  At least now I was seeing the characters from the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus</a>.
It’s just … they weren’t the right characters.  Worse, the design was
stuck in some kind of loop producing the same character over and over again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To understand what happened next, you need to understand that my
<a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus</a>
has historically been <a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone
based</a>.  To get
access to the new (AXI-based) component, I was using a (recently built)
serial port to native AXI bus bridge.  This new component represented
an awesome core for debugging an AXI-based design.  It even supported
AXI read bursts over UART.  The only problem was it hadn’t been
verified to the same standards as the rest of the project.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the next two problems were traced to this new/updated core.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In one ridiculously simple component of the <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus</a>,
I had messed up a <a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">basic valid/ready handshaking protocol</a>.  The result was
the endless loop discussed above–forever outputting the same character.
This should’ve been caught in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cover()</code> check that covered the return
to idle following two operations–it’s just that this particular
component was so simple I hadn’t seen the need to do so.</p>

        <p>For reference, the component in question was an upgraded version of <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipversa/blob/master/rtl/wbubus/wbutohex.v">this
one</a>.</p>

        <p>Even at this point, the design still wasn’t working.  At least now it
wasn’t looping on the output–it just wasn’t producing a meaningful
output (yet).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The next problem was that the <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus</a>
was forever producing a “<a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-wb-master.html">New address</a>”
result.  This was traced to the difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;&amp;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">||</code>.
Instead of checking for if the read side was idle <em>AND</em> the write
side was idle, I checked for whether or not the read side <em>OR</em> the
write side was idle–something that would always be true.  This was
also a difference between the
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>
controller and an <a href="/blog/2020/03/23/wbm2axisp.html">AXI one</a>, since the
AXI controller had read and write halves–something the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/08/simple-wb-master.html">Wishbone version</a>
never had to deal with.</p>

        <p>I would’ve caught this if I had properly covered every core
operation.  Moreover, I <em>should’ve</em> had an assertion to check every
output, but hadn’t gone that far with this new core yet.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Before leaving the discussion of this debugging bus AXI master, I
  should note that this particular AXI controller is a very different
  controller from the UUT I had built for my client–but we’ll come back
  to that in a bit.</p>

<p>Had I checked this design in simulation first, I would’ve found all of
  these bugs.  Sure, I had simulated the design already, just not with the
  <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus</a>
  attached.  After all, I was only attaching to it a known and working
  capability, right?</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li>At this point, you’d figure that everything should (finally) work.
Nope.  Not yet.  At this point, however, my simulation traces looked good.
Yes, you read that right: I wasn’t debugging in hardware anymore, I’d had
to switch back to simulation–to include simulating the
<a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus</a>
(now).  Indeed, the last two bugs had been found via simulation–just not
simulation first like I should’ve done.  The problem now was that although
things “looked right” in the simulation waveform, my control program wasn’t
seeing responses to any bus request commands issued over the serial port.</li>
</ol>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 10. Bridging from TCP/IP to serial</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/four-keys/netuart.svg" alt="" width="420" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This was a bit of a surprise for me.  I’d used this same control program
   for years.  What was left to debug in this program?</p>

<p>A lot, apparently.</p>

<p>I was able to trace the problem to a program I use in just about all of my
   designs to bridge from a <a href="/blog/2017/06/17/why-network-debugging.html">TCP/IP port to a serial
   port</a>.</p>

<p>This network bridging program was originally written to handle a
   <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus</a>
   protocol only, as shown in the top of Fig. 10 on the right.  I had then
   adjusted this bridge so that it would multiplex a console channel onto the
   same serial port, so I could support a console on devices having only one
   serial port.  The problem now was that my bus command requests were getting
   sent to the console port and ignored by the design.  Once I fixed that,
   I then had the same problem in reverse: the results weren’t being routed
   back to the
   <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging bus</a>’s
   <a href="/blog/2017/06/17/why-network-debugging.html">TCP/IP port</a>, but rather to the
   (non-existent) console port–the one I wasn’t using in this particular
   design.</p>

<p>Once fixed, things were finally starting to look right.  I could now
   read and write registers within my design like I had expected to from the
   beginning.  Indeed, I could now actually test the component my client
   was asking me to test.</p>

<p>I had also been thoroughly humbled by this process.  Here I was, wanting to
   write a “four keys” to success article, and clearly reality wasn’t in my
   favor.  Worse, it wasn’t quite done with me yet.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There was one more unexpected problem with the <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">debugging
bus</a> protocol
I’d used for years: there was no way to reset the bus bridge without also
resetting the entire design.  This had never been a problem when using
<a href="/zipcpu/2017/11/07/wb-formal.html">Wishbone</a>,
since I could always abort any bus transaction if necessary to
synchronize with the bus.  Sadly, <a href="/blog/2020/03/14/axi-reset.html">with AXI this was no
longer possible</a>.
Worse, I found myself connecting to the design only to get a dump from
the last command that I had tried to abort–responses my software wasn’t
expecting that would cause any new command to fail.</p>

    <p>We might argue that this particular problem was a <em>validation</em> failure
rather than a <em>verification</em> failure.  The AXI-based <a href="/blog/2017/06/05/wb-bridge-overview.html">UART bus
bridge</a>
<em>worked according to its specification</em>, it just didn’t work in a
practical AXI design.  It didn’t work in a way I hadn’t foreseen.</p>

    <p>Fixing the bridge was easy, though, since I now had the properties I needed
to verify that any changes meant it was still working.  I just created a
special “bus reset” command sequence and had the AXI controller go
through a <a href="/blog/2020/03/14/axi-reset.html">soft reset</a>.
The end result worked like a charm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last “bug” I came across was due to the difference between
Micron and Spansion flash chips.  The two chips have <a href="/blog/2019/03/27/qflexpress.html">very different
command sequences</a>,
and my software had been written to support the easier Spansion command
set rather than the Micron chip on the board I was testing with.</p>

    <p>This bug happened to be the only bug that was even related to the
controller I was testing.  Thankfully, the controller was configurable
enough (by design) to handle both chips–it just needed its software
adjusted (slightly) to handle the Micron chip.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now here’s the clincher: <em>None of these bugs were found in RTL the design I
had built for my client.</em>  The four rules above worked–even though the
control software needed some updates.  The only problem I had with the
four rules was simply that I hadn’t applied them uniformly across the
entire hardware design.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In spite of my troubles, I’m still going to claim that the four rules listed
above sum up my current best formula for success.  I seem to have stumbled
upon them, but so far they have worked quite well for me.  More than
that, they’ve worked reliably for me whenever I’ve had the discipline to
use them together, so let me now commend them to you.</p>

<p>Does it take work?  Yes.  Obviously.  However, I suppose you have a choice.
Do you want to debug a design in silicon, where you have only limited insight
(if any) into what’s going on, in simulation, where traces can extend across
hundreds of millions of cycles, or would you rather debug a short trace of
5-20 steps where you can see everything?</p>

<p>Indeed, [Mahesh]’s comment below tells most of the story here:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whenever I try to &quot;save time&quot; by not simulating &quot;straightforward stuff&quot;, I waste twice the amount of time, and in the end crawl back to simulation.🙂 FPGA hell is real. Do read this excellent article by <a href="https://twitter.com/zipcpu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@zipcpu</a> on it: <a href="https://t.co/FTMX651NaW">https://t.co/FTMX651NaW</a> <a href="https://t.co/kCEl2lc0ZM">pic.twitter.com/kCEl2lc0ZM</a></p>&mdash; Mahesh Venkitachalam (@mkvenkit) <a href="https://twitter.com/mkvenkit/status/1268867831807934465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In my case, whenever I try to save time by not following the four steps
above–even before simulation, I then find myself “crawling back” to
these same steps–long before going back to simulation.</p>

<p>Why not simulation before formal?  Formal traces are shorter and smaller, and
so the logic you need to check for an error is simpler logic.  In short: it’s
easier.  That’s one of many reasons why I like using
formal methods when designing any new core.</p>
