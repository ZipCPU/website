    <p>It’s not uncommon in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
design to have a design that “works in simulation”, but fails the ultimate test
in hardware.  I might argue that within
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
designs, this is almost cliche.  While I’d like to blame the problem on
poor test design, it can also happen with <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a> if you haven’t
fully verified your design.</p>

<p>Since this happens more often that I’d like to admit, let’s ask the question
of whether or not <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a> can help find a bug
within an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
design that is built, complete, loaded onto a piece of hardware, and yet
doesn’t work.</p>

<p>The immediate answer shouldn’t surprise anyone: It depends.  Sometimes
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
can help, sometimes they can’t.</p>

<p>For example, if you look through my <a href="/blog/2018/08/04/sim-mismatch.html">list of reasons why a design might
pass simulation, but still fail in
hardware</a>, you’ll
see several situations where <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a> aren’t going to
help much.  A classic example would be “timing problems.”  While <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a> can help
when you are crossing clock domains, they can’t do as much to help when logic
within your implemented design can’t make it from one
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)">FF</a> to the next
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)">FF</a>
within a single clock period.  In a similar manner, <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a> aren’t going to help
when you haven’t handled your I/O timing well.</p>

<p>Where <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a> <em>can</em>
help is in eliminating possible causes of problems.</p>

<p>For example, I recently tried to run my <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/tttt">4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe
game</a> on the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a>
within an <a href="http://www.icoboard.org">ICO board</a>.
Much to my dismay, <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip">my design</a> didn’t load
onto the board properly.  Digging deeper, I discovered that read and write
requests of the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/README.md">debugging
bus</a>
were missing their acknowledgments.  I struggled to figure out what was going
on.  Where should I even look for the problem?</p>

<p>In this example, <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a> were able to
help me.  Let me outline three ways in which <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a> can help in such
a case, and then tell you what I found.  Using
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>, you can …</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Build a better test bench</p>

    <p>One of the reasons why I got involved in <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a> in the first
place was because my test bench authoring methods were just too poor to be
complete.  I’ve since replaced my individual test benches with proofs using
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>.  These
tend to be of a higher quality, and they tend to find more bugs.</p>

    <p>While saying you should build a better bench test is sort of like saying
you should’ve built in right in the first place, it can help to go back
and thoroughly examine a component that you think might have faults within
it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Cover” the problem</p>

    <p>Once you see a problem in your logic within hardware, sometimes it helps
to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cover</code> the situation.  In this case, you would pick a component, and
describe within that component a situation that you think is happening
in hardware.  If you then <code class="highlighter-rouge">cover()</code> that situation, you can then get a trace
showing how your design might get into that situation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assert the problem will never happen</p>

    <p>Alternatively, if the state the design gets into is an “illegal state”
that it should never get into, then it might help to <code class="highlighter-rouge">assert()</code> that it
should never happen.  For example, if your design outputs values one and
three but skips the second value, then you can make an assertion that it
will never skip values and see if you can formally prove that assertion.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the case I outlined above, I had a two sides of an interface I was working
with.  To illustrate, consider Fig 1 below.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: none"><caption>Fig 1: ICO Board Parallel Port bug</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/ico-pport-bug.svg" alt="" width="640" /></td></tr></table>

<p>One side of this interface had my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
logic on it, and the other side contained
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/sw/host/netpport.cpp">software</a>
on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>.  By inspection, I could see
that data was getting dropped in the interface.  But which side was at fault?</p>

<p>Perhaps you might remember the module of interest on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>: it was the
same <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/README.md">debugging bus
core</a> we built here
on the blog before I discovered <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a>.  Since
it had never been
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verified</a>, I
<em>suspected</em> a fault within it.</p>

<p>If you remember the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/README.md">design</a>
from when we built it, the return data path following the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbexec.v">bus
request</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/rtl/hbbus.v">consisted of a series of separate
stages</a>, each
with back pressure.  In other words,
each stage was given a stall signal from the next stage, and generated a stall
signal for the prior stage.  Similarly, each stage created a data valid
signal I called a “strobe”.  Together with this data valid signal was data
that should be output from the stage.
I’ve written about this <a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">pipelining strategy
before</a>,
calling it the <a href="/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html">“travelling CE”
strategy</a>.</p>

<p>This was one obvious place where data might be lost.</p>

<p>I simply wanted to verify that no data would ever be lost in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Therefore I went through all of the stages within the interface, and added
an assertion between the various stages: if the current stage was producing a
valid output but the next stage was busy, then the same data should still be
valid on the next clock.  No changes were allowed, and data was not allowed
to be dropped.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">posedge</span> <span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">f_past_valid</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">($</span><span class="nb">past</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_busy</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">($</span><span class="nb">past</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_valid</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="k">begin</span>
	<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_valid</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">($</span><span class="nb">stable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o_data</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Of course, this assertion didn’t pass at first.  When I dug further, I found
some race conditions within my code.  I also found a couple of cases where a
value would be created by one of the stages, but yet it was designed to be
pre-empted should a newer value show up.  So I spent a bit of time to <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/rtl/hexbus/">clean
up the code and my
properties</a>,
and eventually it passed <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">forma
 verification</a> through
and through.</p>

<p>The only problem was this interface still didn’t work, and hence I still
couldn’t play <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/tttt">4x4x4 tic-tac-toe</a>
using the <a href="/about/zipcpu.html">ZipCPU</a> on the
<a href="http://www.icoboard.org">icoboard</a>.</p>

<p>This time, though, I now knew that my
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/dbgbus/blob/master/hexbus/README.md">debugging bus</a>
would <em>NEVER</em> skip data words.</p>

<p>That meant the problem had to lie within the
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/sw/host/netpport.cpp">code</a>.
Sure enough, I found something similar to the following logic.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="n">data_read</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">read_data</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number_requested</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">buffer</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">while</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">iterations</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">MAX_ITERATIONS</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data_read</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="c1">//
</span>	<span class="c1">// Process the data
</span>	<span class="c1">//
</span>
	<span class="c1">// Read the next data
</span>	<span class="n">data_read</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">read_data</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number_requested</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">buffer</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This was supposed to read the data from my device and process it.  To keep the
routine from hanging, it would only repeat the loop <code class="highlighter-rouge">MAX_ITERATIONS</code> times.</p>

<p>See the bug?</p>

<p>And to think, I was chasing this all over my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
design wondering what was going wrong.  Once I
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verified</a> through
the relevant portions of my
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> code, I
was able to stop chasing phantoms and move quickly to the real problem.</p>

<p>My point is here is simply this: <a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal
methods</a> can still help–even
when the design is already implemented in (and failing in) hardware.</p>
