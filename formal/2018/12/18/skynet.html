    <p>If there’s one thing I hate, it’s admitting I’m wrong.  Today, I need to do
that.</p>

<p>One of the very real and practical difficulties of working with
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal methods</a>
is managing the complexity.
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">Formal methods</a>
are roughly exponential in their complexity.  Practically, this means that
there is a limit to the complexity of any design that you wish to
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verify</a>.
This means that the engineer using
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">formal tools</a>
needs to carefully consider what parts of the design to
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verify</a>,
and how to carefully break the entire design into smaller pieces that can
verified individually.</p>

<p><a href="/formal/2018/04/23/invariant.html">I discussed one possible way of doing this
before</a>,
as part of aggregating
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verified</a>
modules together.  The basic approach I used was to
verify the smaller “leaf” sub-modules, and then to aggregate up to larger
modules.  When aggregating up, I used an approach suggested to me by
<a href="https://www.onespin.com">another</a>:
swap the assumptions with the assertions of the submodule.  That way, you
verify that the assumptions made within the submodule hold as part of verifying
the parent module.</p>

<p>Pictorially, I explained this concept using Fig 1.</p>

<table align="center" style="float: left"><caption>Fig 1. Invariants applied to a parent/leaf module hierarchy</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/invariance-external.svg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p>This picture shows the verification process in two parts.  The first part,
on the left,
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verifies</a>
the submodule(s).  These are verified as independent modules from the parent.</p>

<p>For the second part of the verification shown in Fig. 1, the parent modules
are verified, with the submodules beneath them.  In this case, the assumptions
about the submodules inputs are transformed into assertions, and the assertions
within the submodule are then transformed into assumptions.  The idea is that
if you’ve already proven that the assertions of the submodule hold given the
assumptions, then all you need do is to verify the assumptions of the submodule
and you then know that the assertions will pass.</p>

<p>I’ve now used this logic within many of my designs, and I’ve been very pleased
with it.</p>

<p>The only problem with it?  It doesn’t work.  It can lead to false negatives,
where you believe your design works when in actuality it does not.</p>

<h2 id="skynet">Skynet</h2>

<table align="center" style="float: right"><caption>Fig 2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a>, the fictional AI system created by Cyberdyne Systems that tried to destroy all of humanity</caption><tr><td><img src="/img/skynet.jpg" alt="" width="480" /></td></tr></table>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/oe1cxw">Clifford Wolf</a> was kind enough to provide the
necessary counter example, framed in terms of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a>, the fictional
defense machine that decided to kill all humans as part of the back story
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)">Terminator</a>.</p>

<p>It goes like this, suppose we have a simple design that determines whether
or not all humanity should be destroyed.  The designers of this system were
smart enough to formally verify it, and so they had a strong confidence that
humanity would never be destroyed.</p>

<p>Because of the logic flaw we’ll be discussing today, their confidence was
a false confidence.</p>

<p>Imagine their logic was something as simple as logic below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">module</span>	<span class="n">skynet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">i_input</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">o_kill_all_humans</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="kt">input</span>	<span class="kt">wire</span>		<span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="kt">input</span>	<span class="kt">wire</span>	<span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>	<span class="n">i_input</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="kt">output</span>	<span class="kt">reg</span>		<span class="n">o_kill_all_humans</span><span class="o">;</span>

	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">o_kill_all_humans</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_input</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mh">32'hdeadbeef</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Since we obviously don’t want to kill everyone, we add a formal section to this
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Skynet logic</a>
to make certain <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_kill_all_humans</code> will never be asserted,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="cp">`ifdef</span>	<span class="n">FORMAL</span>
	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="k">assume</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_input</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mh">32'hdeadbeef</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span>

	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="k">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">o_kill_all_humans</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="cp">`endif</span>
<span class="k">endmodule</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Running <a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>
on <a href="/examples/skynet.v">this logic</a> will assure us that
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Skynet</a>
will never decide to destroy all of humanity.</p>

<p>If only the story stopped there.</p>

<h2 id="placing-skynet-in-within-cyberdyne-systems">Placing Skynet in within Cyberdyne Systems</h2>

<p>The problem lies in the next step.  Using the approach we discussed before,
we’ll replace the <code class="highlighter-rouge">assume</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">assert</code> statements with macros.  These
macros are defined depending upon whether or not we are
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verifying</a>
the <a href="/examples/skynet.v">submodule (skynet)</a>,
or its parent–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Cyberdyne
Systems</a>.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll start by creating the various macros, depending upon whether
or not <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUBMODULE</code> is defined.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="cp">`ifdef</span>	<span class="n">SUBMODULE</span>
<span class="cp">`define</span>	ASSUME	assume<span class="cp">
`define</span>	ASSERT	assert<span class="cp">
`else</span>
<span class="cp">`define</span>	ASSUME	assert<span class="cp">
`define</span>	ASSERT	assume<span class="cp">
`endif</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Using these macros, we can then rewrite our two formal properties:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="cp">`ifdef</span>	<span class="n">FORMAL</span>
	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="cp">`ASSUME</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_input</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mh">32'hdeadbeef</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span>

	<span class="k">always</span> <span class="o">@</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="cp">`ASSERT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">o_kill_all_humans</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, as long as SUBMODULE remains defined, we can still prove that
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Skynet</a>
will not destroy all humans.</p>

<p>Let’s add
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Skynet</a>’s <a href="/examples/skynet.v">parent module, Cyberdyne
Systems</a>.  We’ll keep
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Cyberdyne</a>
simple: there’s no logic within it at all.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="n">cyberdyne_systems</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">i_input</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">o_kill_everyone</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="kt">input</span>	<span class="kt">wire</span>		<span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="kt">input</span>	<span class="kt">wire</span>	<span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">31</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>	<span class="n">i_input</span><span class="o">;</span>
	<span class="kt">output</span>	<span class="kt">wire</span>		<span class="n">o_kill_everyone</span><span class="o">;</span>

	<span class="n">skynet</span> <span class="n">determine_fate_of_humanity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i_clk</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">i_input</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">o_kill_everyone</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="k">endmodule</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see, nothing in the logic of
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Cyberdyne</a> prevents
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Skynet</a>
from being corrupted and killing all humans.</p>

<p>By design this proof should fail, alerting us to the possibility that
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Skynet</a> was never properly constrained.</p>

<p>It does not fail.  Instead, <a href="/examples/skynet.v">Cyberdyne</a>
releases a monster.  Why wasn’t it caught during
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formal verification</a>?</p>

<h2 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong?</h2>

<p>We did everything right so far: We
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verified</a> that
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Skynet</a>
would never
kill all humans as long as the input was never equal to <code class="highlighter-rouge">32'hdeadbeef</code>.  We
even asserted that the input would never equal <code class="highlighter-rouge">32'hdeadbeef</code>, and this
assertion passed.  We then
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verified</a>
both components together, proving that humanity was safe.  However, you
can see from inspection that <em>nothing</em> keeps the input from being
<code class="highlighter-rouge">32'hdeadbeef</code>.</p>

<p>What happened?  Why didn’t this proof fail when it should have?</p>

<p>The problem is simple: the critical assertion, that <code class="highlighter-rouge">o_kill_all_humans</code>, 
would never be true was converted into an assumption.  Assumptions, if you will
recall, limit the space of what the solver examines.  They take precedence
over assertions.  In this case, the assertion turned assumption
prevented <code class="highlighter-rouge">i_input</code> from becoming <code class="highlighter-rouge">32'hdeadbeef</code> within the solver since
this would’ve caused the assumption to be violated.</p>

<h2 id="rescuing-this-logic">Rescuing this logic</h2>

<p>There are a couple of things we can do to try to “rescue” this method, none
of them are truly as nice as the initial method appeared to be in the first
place.  We can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Remove all of the logic within
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Skynet</a>,
leaving only the formal properties behind.</p>

    <p>Because there’s no logic between the input assumptions, now turned into
assertions, and the output assertions, now turned into assumptions, the
output could be anything depending upon the choice of the solver.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep the logic within
<a href="/examples/skynet.v">Skynet</a>,
replace the original submodule assumptions
with an assertion, and then remove all of the local assertions.</p>

    <p>Sadly, this approach doesn’t work with
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>,
as it can leave the local registers within a module unconstrained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Replace the assumptions with assertions, but leave the original assertions
untouched.  Hence we would have only <code class="highlighter-rouge">assert</code> properties within the
submodule design.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span class="cp">`define</span>	<span class="n">ASSERT</span>	<span class="k">assert</span>
<span class="cp">`ifdef</span>	<span class="n">SUBMODULE</span>
<span class="cp">`define</span>	ASSUME	assume<span class="cp">
`else</span>
<span class="cp">`define</span>	ASSUME	assert<span class="cp">
`endif</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is how I am personally going to move forward when aggregating modules.
   It is simple and robust.  The only problem is that the complexity only
   increases upon aggregation.</p>

<p>Indeed, if you apply this method to
   <a href="/examples/skynet.v"><code class="highlighter-rouge">skynet.v</code></a>,
   you’ll find that the
   parent proof fails (as desired), revealing that nothing is keeping
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a> from killing
   all humans.</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <p>If we could adjust the formal engine, there would be another approach.</p>

    <p>Normally, during
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>,
all of the assertions are treated as assumptions
until the last step.  This allows these assertions to constrain the design
until the last step, helping the design enter into a valid state during the
run-up to the final stage of the proof.  Then, in that final state, the
assertions are applied and the design succeeds or fails.</p>

    <p>If we could create a third type of assertion, let’s call it <code class="highlighter-rouge">iassert</code> for
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>
assertion, another approach might work.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">iassert()</code>
would be ignored during the base case prior to the induction.  During the
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">inductive</a>
step, <code class="highlighter-rouge">iassert()</code>
would apply as an assumption for the first <code class="highlighter-rouge">k</code> steps of
<a href="/blog/2018/03/10/induction-exercise.html">induction</a>,
and then get ignored on the last step leaving behind all of the other
assertions.</p>

    <p>Of course, this would only work if the first pass (submodule) verification
evaluated <code class="highlighter-rouge">iassert</code> as though it were a true assertion.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps you are wondering how likely it is that this flawed approach,
discussed above, would result in a false alarm.  While I haven’t been keeping
score, I’ve seen problems in many of my proofs that had used this approach.
The rate may even be as high as thirty percent or more, depending upon the
design.  It’s high enough that you cannot ignore it.  Indeed, the proof I
was working on this morning passed until I “fixed” it with one of the
approaches above, revealing a false alarm due to this approach.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The bottom line is that the <a href="/formal/2018/04/23/invariant.html">approach to formal aggregation that I presented
earlier</a> doesn’t work,
leading instead to a false confidence that your “formally verified” design
works.</p>

<p>I’m slowly converting my own logic to use approach 3 above, and recommend
that if you’ve been using this approach that you consider doing so as well.</p>
